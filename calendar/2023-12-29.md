## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to go out and eat
- being able to spend time in the water

### Today's efforts

-

## Evening Summary

Completely exhausted... indecision of others is tiring. Planning and doing things for weeks on end is exhausting. It's less work to not be on leave. Feeling overwhelmed and in need of downtime - fewer people, fewer complaints, fewer plans, more quiet

### Things that went well

- surfed
- met Talita, Eddie's partner, in the water

### Things I could have done better

- acknowledged that making spontaneous plans with anyone while being with those people is going to come down to me saying no. Just say no, and move on. 

### Tomorrow's efforts

- get to Cederberg safely
