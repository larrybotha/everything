## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to benefit from information provided by people like Andrew Huberman
- being able to afford healthy food
- being able to choose when to do work to accommodate a more flexible schedule

### Today's efforts

- wake at 6 and get light
- complete 1 Rust section
- complete lambda section
- eat at 11am
- do Charlie tasks 
- get to bed at 9:30
- complete day sheet refactoring
- begin work on arrival queue
- follow up with Jira ticket 

## Evening Summary

For the lambda calculus chapter, I made the following realisations:

- the function we're making recursive using the general approach is derived from a recursive function which is self-referencing
	- because of [[Î² reduction|normal order reduction]] we cannot use such a function - it'll never terminate
	- for purpose of the definition of the recursive factory function we're building, the higher order function we create from recursive function abstracts the recursion only at a single location - i.e. it doesn't pass it's callback to itself
	- because of this implementation, the result is a non-recursive function with a single abstraction at the point of recursion in the original function
	- using the `add1 add1` example in ch 4 of [[An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus]], we can confirm that this abstraction is not recursive
	- using this information, along with the `add2 add2` example, we can then use [[self-application - the lambda calculus|self_apply]] to derive an *application*, not a function, that is evaluated under certain conditions in the non-recursive function
		- it ensures that self application continues, as in `add2`
		- the mechanism for copying the non-recursive function is self-replicating
	- we then have a function which builds recursive functions from non-recursive functions that have certain criteria:
		- are derived from self-referencing recursive functions
		- have a single abstraction at the point of recursion in the original function

### Things that went well

- opened our cacao nibs which are delicious - hopefully it's easy to find quality nibs in South Africa
- refactored a lot of complexity related to appointments
- made big strides in understanding the lambda calculus chapter on recursion

### Things I could have done better

- been more patient when we were getting ready to go for our morning walk - I don't need much time to get ready

### Tomorrow's efforts

- order hair stuff so that I can pay on Monday morning before we leave
- get light at 5
- complete day sheet refactoring
- refactor arrival queue
- enjoy the rugby 
- pack all of our bags
- get washing done
- book table at restaurant in Parkhurst
- message Lyall about working at our place
- get to bed at 8:30
