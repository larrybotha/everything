## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- understood how to handle uploading and removal of images from entity
- saw Lyall

### Things I could have done better

- not wasted my time watching meaningless stuff on YouTube and going to bed late
- done anything to advance my knowledge outside of work
- speaking badly of my past self to friends
	- it makes me seem like I'm looking for validation
	- who I was is part of who I now am. I still have work to do, but it's not useful to use harsh labels to describe who I was. Speak in terms of facts, instead of labels 

### Tomorrow's efforts

- go to bed 10:30 latest
- be present
- complete Rust section
- enjoy my time with my friends
