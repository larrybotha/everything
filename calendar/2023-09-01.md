## Morning Summary

Realised yesterday that in addition to doing videos on things like the underlying workings of [[std..option..Option..take]] at I mentioned in [[2023-08-25]], Python's abstractions are nice to cover, too, such as `defaultdict`, `Set.difference`

### I'm grateful for...
- being able to walk around safely at night in Ecuador
- having the opportunity to work on engaging problems
- being able to sit in a garden in the morning to do my notes

### Today's efforts
- complete 2 legacy migrations
- begin refactoring of resource FKs on appointments
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- be cognizant of frustration while surfing
- focus on keeping knees down while surfing
- check Servientrega for package
- roll expiring trades

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well
- fixed a tricky bug related to reserving time slots
- surfed despite difficult conditions, and spraining my pinky toe 
- Ali bought me a delicious alfajor
- did an ice bath and handled the cold relatively well, although the water may not have been as cold as it was for others

### Things I could have done better
- been thoughtful of prods to change my behaviour, and either considered them, or or let myself be water flowing over rocks 

### Tomorrow's efforts
- complete Rust chapter
- be present for my delicious meal at Bhakti
- do Yoga Nidra
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- replace the exercise I would get from surfing with something else
