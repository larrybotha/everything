## Morning Summary

Realised yesterday that in addition to doing videos on things like the underlying workings of [[std..option..Option..take]] at I mentioned in [[2023-08-25]], Python's abstractions are nice to cover, too, such as `defaultdict`, `Set.difference`

### I'm grateful for...
- being able to walk around safely at night in Ecuador
- having the opportunity to work on engaging problems
- being able to sit in a garden in the morning to do my notes

### Today's efforts
- complete 2 legacy migrations
- begin refactoring of resource FKs on appointments
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- be cognizant of frustration while surfing
- focus on keeping knees down while surfing
- check Servientrega for package
- roll expiring trades
