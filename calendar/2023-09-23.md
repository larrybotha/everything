## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

### Things I could have done better

- not jumped to conclusions about the police / farmer shoot out with the robbers in Hoedspruit - news and information shared via social media should always be considered to be missing critical context until fact-checked with a reliable source

### Tomorrow's efforts
