## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to sleep well
- being able to visit friends when I return home
- having the opportunity to learn challenging things

### Today's efforts

- message Rolandi if I can't determine what my next appointment needs to be, otherwise book next appointment
- do Yoga Nidra
- do 1 Rust section
- be present
- check if Servientrega has responded 

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- had delicious Italian food at Sfoglia
- had the best dark chocolate ice cream we've had since going to Greece at Chocolateria San Fernando
- learnt about how the cacao industry in Guayaquil is a big part of why the city became a hub
- worked out most of the recursion implementation in

### Things I could have done better

- not jumped to conclusions about the police / farmer shoot out with the robbers in Hoedspruit - news and information shared via social media should always be considered to be missing critical context until fact-checked with a reliable source

### Tomorrow's efforts
