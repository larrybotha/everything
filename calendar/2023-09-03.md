## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to enjoy delicious food while traveling to other countries
- meeting awesome people
- being able to sleep well most of the time

### Today's efforts

- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- do Yoga Nidra to solidify learning
- complete notes on Rust chapter
- consider the questions people ask me, and be brief and clear on my responses, as opposed to my usual verbose responses and assumptions of what people were asking

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- completed the Rust tutorial chapter with minimal assistance
- had pretty good corviche
- Ali and I fed an underfed sausage dog
- Ali had a good surf session
- sprained toe is feeling much better - will hopefully be ready for me to surf on Tuesday

### Things I could have done better

- not given positive feedback to someone about someone else they hope likes them - I don't know what the other person is thinking, and was essentially on the giving end of what [[The Mom Test]] warns against when receiving feedback - trying to preserve one's feelings while giving them misleading information
### Tomorrow's efforts

- prepare migration for linking appointments and resources
- replace 2 legacy groups
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- do Yoga Nidra to solidify learning
