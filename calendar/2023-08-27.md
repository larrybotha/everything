## Morning Summary

Found [this list](https://we.riseup.net/sotfe/confidence) in the [[Confidence]] note which organises related material in 3 groups:

- complementary to the current topic
- contrasting to the current topic
- in tension with the current topic
  Would be useful to adopt this approach when taking notes

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to speak easily with people I've never met
- to be able to eat delicious things like Alfajores because I travel
- to recall lessons I learnt when I was younger and strive to reinforce the good behaviours I developed then

### Today's efforts

- keep knees down when popping up, despite the sore on my knee
- avoid being unnecessarily negative when chatting with Chris
- be present when spending our time with our friends in Ayampe
- remain silent when tempted to speak badly of others
- do 1 Rust section
- summarise 2 Huberman Lab sections

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- surfed
- healed Ali's foot from sting ray
- tried Corviche which was tasty
- made salted pineapple
- tried a delicious alfajor from Tia
- chatted with Christoff
- did Yoga Nidra
- didn't speak badly of anyone to anyone but Ali - could improve on this by not ever speaking badly of people

### Things I could have done better

- been more cognizant of knee positioning when surfing

### Tomorrow's efforts

- complete 3 legacy group migrations
- prevent dropdown menu exceptions
- do 1 section in Rust tutorial
- summarise 2 sections in Huberman Lab podcast episode
- do Yoga Nidra to solidify learning
- visualise popping up in morning and evening
