## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to work in nature
- being able to afford going out for dinner
- having options for work I can do

### Today's efforts

- complete Rust chapter
- tally complaints
- tally overconfidence
- tally social media avoidance
- evaluate reported bugs
- complete legacy group refactoring
- buy Jessica's book
- complete all chin ups and archer push-ups

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- fixed a few bugs
- mostly completed the rendering of a complex feature

### Things I could have done better

- not wasted my time reading about current affairs - there's nothing valuable I can do with the information, out pollutes the way I think about the world, and it has an opportunity cost
- didn't feel like doing exercise, so I didn't instead of pushing through

### Tomorrow's efforts

- complete grid rendering
- fix 2 legacy groups
- do full set of exercises
- tally complaints
- tally overconfidence
- complete 1 Rust chapter
- but Jessica's book
