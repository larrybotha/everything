## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- refactored and simplified appointment grid
- contacted man date mandate guys about upcoming dates
- sorta got feedback from servientrega about DHL delivery
- acknowledged when I was wasting time on Instagram and got back to Obsidian
- worked out how to do global replacements on files in vim using `:cdo`
	- populate quick fix using `:grep foo`
	- replace using `:cdo s/foo/bar/g`

### Things I could have done better

- acknowledged when opening the Instagram link that their intention is for me to continue scrolling, and make sure that I only watch the linked video, and then close it - opportunity cost!
