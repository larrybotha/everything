## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to rest when I'm sick
- being able to use free software to make my life easier

### Today's efforts

- continue with PGS process
- evaluate DHL status
- visualise pop-ups
- do Yoga Nidra
- rest
- handle remaining pre-holiday trades
- evaluate Simple Portfolio

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- paid for PGS - need to sign the docs now
- determined that Simple Portfolio is *very* simple in terms of what their free tier offers - it's primarily a reporting tool, visualising data provided by the user, not even via an API
- feeling way better after more rest
- visualised pop-ups in the morning
- did Yoga Nidra immediately after waking because I felt like crap and slept little last night
- realised that in Arc I can play videos side by side with the annotations, which I can highlight and then take across to Obsidian 

### Things I could have done better

- complained less, or not complained at all. It's draining to not only hear someone moaning verbally about things, but also to hear them endlessly grunting from exhaustion 

### Tomorrow's efforts

- enjoy our excursion to Ol√≥n
- take it easy
- sign PGS docs
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- do Yoga Nidra
