## Morning Summary

I'm still tired, so I need to be aware that I'm likely going to:

- be irritable
- going to acknowledge when people say things to me, but not actually listen to what was said

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to mitigate my jet lag
- being back home
- having challenging work to do

### Today's efforts

- exercise
- complete arrival queue refactor
- replace 2 legacy groups
- follow up with Jira
- look for bamboo underwear on Takealot
- complete Rust section
- respond to WhatsApp backlog
- call dentist to see if it's possible to reschedule, otherwise book new licence appointment
- get to bed at 9:30

## Evening Summary

All trading accounts were early exercised in the PUTs - 9 days early. They had the following details:

SPY OCT 13 PUT@3.38
Market price at assignment: 422.75 (4.4% below strike)

I didn't expect options to be exercised this far ahead of expiration

Also got a margin call on my account which resulted in:

- IBKR automatically selling 129 shares of SPY
- 1 of my LEAP PUTs being sold
- having to fund the account - deposited $5 at 19.34 ZAR to USD

### Things that went well

- resolved most trading issues

### Things I could have done better

- not complained about my hair being thin 
	- I need to do one of the following:
		- accept it and shave my hair
		- continue with treatment as is
		- take the medication that has side effects
		- research what I can do in addition to, or instead of what I'm doing
	- I may not do one of the following:
		- complain about it
- not complained about the irritating person who we had dinner with this evening
	- yes, she's shit, but she's unlikely to change. Accept it, and deal with it, or reframe it
- not spoken up for the partner of the irritating person when they treated their partner poorly

### Tomorrow's efforts

- exercise
- no complaining
- be present
- no carbs
- style navigation for nesting
- add view for treatment setups
- complete 1 legacy group refactoring
- follow up with WhatsApps
- do something to improve my programming skills... stop wasting time
- get to bed at 9:30
