## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to enjoy a holiday in a remote place
- being able to snorkel with sharks 
- having the resources to take time off

### Today's efforts

- avoid speaking badly of anyone or anything
- be present 
- complete Huberman Lab Episode eval 
- be thoughtful of others
- transfer one section of lambda calculus to Obsidian
- visualise pop-ups
- do Yoga Nidra

## Evening Summary

- sea lions have external ears - seals do not
- seals and sea lions walk differently 
- the sea lions in the Galapagos are very cute and inquisitive
- the five doves that are endemic here are not phased by humans being near them. They look somewhat like miniature franklins
- light between 11pm and 4am is particularly bad for one's health and ability to learn

### Things that went well

- swam with a shark
- swam with turtles
- swam with sea lions
- had delicious food 3 times today
- went on a fascinating hike on Sombrero Chino
- saw flamingos on another island
- had a nap when I was feeling seasick
- resisted speaking badly of South Africans - this is related to the agitation that [[Andrew Huberman]] speaks of in [[Huberman Lab Episode 1 - How Your Nervous System Works & Changes]]

### Things I could have done better

- be present
