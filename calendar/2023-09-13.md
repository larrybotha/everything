## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to take exclusive once in a lifetime trips
- being able to sleep well
- having good health

### Today's efforts

- complete Huberman Lab eval
- visualise pop-ups
- do Yoga Nidra
- be present
- avoid speaking badly of anyone or anything

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- got safely to Galapagos
- saw huge tortoises
- visited the Darwin museum which was interesting
- staying with nice other people on the boat
- completed 30% of next Huberman eval 

### Things I could have done better

- not taken more than my fair share of food for dinner - someone else ended up with nothing because I didn't listen to myself and leave for others. Worse, they knew it was because of me

### Tomorrow's efforts

- be more thoughtful when it comes to shared resources
- be positive, and speak only well of others
- do Yoga Nidra
- visualise pop-ups morning and evening
- begin moving lambda calculus notes to Obsidian
