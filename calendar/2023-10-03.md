## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to travel around the world
- being able to afford the exorbitant price of food in the US
- not having to live in the US

### Today's efforts

- get home safely
- plan tomorrow's efforts

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- mostly stuck to adjusted schedule
- in bed at 9:30 and feels like a normal night
- flights went well
- got a little work done in the airport
- the advice in [[Huberman Lab Podcast Episode 4 - How to defeat jetlag, shift work, and sleeplessness]] seems to be highly effective so far

### Things I could have done better

- when I lack sleep I acknowledge things people say without even knowing it, and without realising they've even said something
- done lambda calculus or Rust instead of watching 3 John Wick movies - opportunity cost

### Tomorrow's efforts

- exercise
- complete arrival queue refactor
- replace 2 legacy groups
- follow up with Jira
- look for bamboo underwear on Takealot
- complete Rust section
- respond to WhatsApp backlog
- call dentist to see if it's possible to reschedule, otherwise book new licence appointment
