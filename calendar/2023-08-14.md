- complete 2 migrations
- remove 1 group from the application
- complete 1 chapter in Rust course
- order hair stuff

## I'm grateful for...
- having the time and health to surf
- being able to learn from individuals with far more experience than I have

## Things that went well
- fixed erroneous migrations
- learnt a little about Lua and Neovim's API
- spoke with my mother

## Things I could have done better
- spent an inordinate amount of time watching Youtube videos again
- didn't work out how to use Servientrega to order hair stuff from South Africa
- spent way too long configuring Vim and Obsidian, rather than learning Rust
