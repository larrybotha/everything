## Morning
- no reading need l news
- no doom scrolling YouTube
- create epics for migrations
- refactor 1 legacy group
- complete 1 section of Rust course
- fix broken plate
- find out from Servientrega about delivery

### I'm grateful for...
- having read books that made me realise I have to be accountable for my actions
- being able to wake up in a different country every few months
- being able to spend money on things beyond my basic needs

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well
- worked out Servientrega deliveries
- ordered hair stuff
- completed 2 legacy group migrations
- resolved a fair amount of technical debt
- watched a fair amount of Andrew Huberman 
- didn't read news or doom scroll YouTube
- completed another mental model note in obsidian
- booked accommodation for Ali
- did a little Rust learning
- got up at 7 and went outside for 30 minutes to get cortisol going
- rolled PUTs
- closed out expiring credit spreads
- opened new credit spreads given that the market is still oversold at a level

### Things I could have done better
- wasted time trying to get the obsidian-git plugin to do it's thing
- only did a fraction of the Rust learning I wanted to because I spent more time working than what I should have - need to protect my time, [[Opportunity cost]] etc.
- the credit spreads I entered didn't leave enough time for the market to work itself out - 2 weeks is way too short for a pull back. I need to evaluate the templates to see what is a better time to mitigate the risk of the market falling further, or stagnating before returning to its trend 

### Tomorrow's tasks
- surf
- complete 3 legacy group migrations
- complete remaining sections of Rust chapter
- add notes from both Andrew Huberman podcasts to obsidian
- fix smashed plate
- prepare Spanish phrases 
- email Isabella
- pay for hair stuff and provide invoice to Servientrega
