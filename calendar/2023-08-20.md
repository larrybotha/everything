## Evening Summary

Went to South Indian Restaurant in Olón today for Ali's birthday - the food was delicious again. Had an ice cream in Olón, went shopping in Montañita, found Inca Kola in a small shop where we bought avos, sat on the beach with Maddy on her last day in Ayampe

It's hard to be told about things that you've done or said that are in poor taste, but it's for one's own good. Bad-mouthing someone is a poor reflection on the speaker, whether what they are saying is accurate or not. The same goes for bad-mouthing a generalised group of people

Instead of taking the criticism personally, view it as an opportunity to improve:

- be cognizant of dislike for someone or a group of people
- when wanting to say something negative and them:
  - find something positive to say about them, or
  - consider the motives behind why they appear to have a certain behaviour, or
  - just don't say anything at all that's negative about them - it's simplistic thinking, it's negative, and is self sabotage
- reframe your disdain for the person or group:
  - consider their motives, backgrounds, and histories that may have led them to where they are
- negativity is a positive feedback loop that is difficult to escape

### Things that went well

- delicious lunch
- tasty ice cream
- did a lot of necessary shopping
- did some walking
- tried Inca Kola - tasted sorta like bubblegum
- sat on the beach and had a beer with Maddy
- had a delicious dinner
- started a "people" vault to manage people I know, and their relationships to each other

### Things I could have done better

- not spoken badly about a generalised group of people to someone

### Tomorrow's tasks

- resolve 3 legacy groups
- complete Rust chapter
- phone mother
- if DHL tracking number is available, send to Servientrega
- do Yoga Nidra
