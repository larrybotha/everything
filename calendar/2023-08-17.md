### I'm grateful for...
- being able to work from anywhere that has internet
- being able to choose accommodation quickly and easily from anywhere around the world
- being able to spend my time learning instead of only surviving
- having easy access to quality information

## Evening Summary
Read some interesting stuff about AI salaries - apparently Netflix was flouting a $900k salary for an AI engineer, and positions at startups are starting at $128k, averaging at about $192k

Interesting stuff in the Huberman Lab podcast where we have a circadian dead zone - trying to shift one's circadian rhythm during this period, with things such as light, temperature, food, or exercise will have no effect - the circadian rhythm can only be affected within 4 hours before or after one's temperature minimum

Temperature minimum is usually 60 - 90 minutes before one wakes up, i.e. 4:30am for those who wake at 6am. Exposure to light within 4 hours _after_ the temperature minimum threshold _phase-advances_ one's circadian rhythm, i.e. makes you want to sleep and wake up earlier. Exposure to light within 4 hours _before_ one's temperature minimum _phase-delays_ one's circadian rhythm - i.e. makes you want to sleep and wake up later

This is important for understanding how to shift one's sleep patterns, in particular when it comes to mitigating jet-lag

### Things that went well
- paid for hair stuff
- simplified and clarified a number of issues in the application
- surfed despite horrid conditions
- watched more of Andrew Huberman's sleep episodes - realised that cold showers at night are potentially working against my circadian rhythm because cold showers result in an increase in temperature, whereas your temperature should be dropping as you approach your usual sleep time
- annotated a bunch of Rust stuff that was eluding me - added notes to Obsidian
- prepared Spanish phrases, but didn't really execute on them due to the shock of being in the middle of the interaction
- had one of the tastiest Indian dishes ever from a South Indian restaurant Ol√≥n; see [[Ecuador#Restaurants]]

### Things I could have done better
- ended up paying almost $120 for delivery of hair stuff from South Africa before even the cost of the product. Next time I need to manage risk more effectively, as I clearly underestimated the factors around:
	- evaporation
	- spillage due to changes in altitude, or just plain clumsiness
	- breaking / losing bottles
 - didn't respond to Isabella - figured my learning was more important, and I can get to it on Saturday
 - didn't make notes of Andrew Huberman episodes I watched

### Tomorrow's tasks
- surf
- complete 3 legacy group migrations
- complete remaining sections of Rust tutorial
- make notes of Huberman Lab podcast episodes
- send invoice and tracking code to Servientrega
