## I'm grateful for...

- being able to meet new people and be generally comfortable chatting with them
- having access to information like Andrew Huberman's podcast to enrich my knowledge of the world

## Things that went well

- got 2 hours of surfing in
- ate healthily
- did a little Rust

## Things I could have done better

- spent less time on YouTube and more time studying
- been more focused while surfing - pop-ups were all over the place
  - eyes up, hands firmly planted, knees, swing legs between hands, hands up when feet are planted
