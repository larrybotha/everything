## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to travel internationally
- being able to afford healthy food
- having challenging things to learn to keep my mind occupied

### Today's efforts

- complete day sheet refactor
- complete arrival queue refactor
- do 1 Rust section
- no news, social media, or wasting time on things that don't benefit anyone
- respond to Charlie
- follow up with Jira

## Evening Summary

In [[Huberman Lab Podcast Episode 4 - How to defeat jetlag, shift work, and sleeplessness]] Andrew Huberman describes how we have the following mechanisms:

- [[circadian dead zone]] - the time of day where light, food, and exercise will have no effect on our sleep schedule, approximately 4 hours after waking up until 6 before sleeping
- [[temperature minimum]] - when our bodies are coolest, about 90 minutes before waking
	- activities within 4 hours after this marker phasea-advance our schedules - we want to sleep and wake earlier
	- activities within 4 hours before this marker phase-delay our sleep - we want to sleep and wake late
- to phase-advance, wake up 1 hour earlier per day for 2 to 3 days before moving time zones
	- light is the most important mechanism for moving your schedule, but it only works outside of the circadian dead zone
	- exercising within the temperature minimum also helps
	- to wake the body, one wants to heat it - the body responds to a cold shower by increasing its heat
	- eating signals a change in schedule, too, so maybe shift one's eating times with their waking times?
- eat in the schedule of the new time zone when you get there 

Traveling East, one wants to phase advance, as you're moving to an earlier time of the day, and vice versa for moving West

### Things that went well

- refactored a few complex views
- almost completed day sheet refactor
- had a delicious lunch and dinner
- watched some of Huberman Lab

### Things I could have done better

- been more critical of what I was working on, and tackled the simpler case, rather than thinking so much about unnecessary complexity

### Tomorrow's efforts

- wake at 6 and get light
- complete 1 Rust section
- complete lambda section
- eat at 11am
- do Charlie tasks 
- get to bed at 9:30
