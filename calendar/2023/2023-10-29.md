## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to enjoy nature in South Africa
- being able to eat out 
- being able to afford clean water

### Today's efforts

- complete 3 Rust chapters
- complete all exercise sets
- get to bed 10:30 latest
- tally complaints
- tally overconfidence
- be conscious of being verbose 

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- did a fair amount of admin
- completed all of my push-ups
- completed most of the Rust chapter, and understood it
- realised that completing the course on lists in Rust is going to yield diminishing returns - I don't need to know about raw pointers etc at this time

### Things I could have done better

- not wasted time on YouTube in the morning

### Tomorrow's efforts

- resolve 2 legacy groups
- continue with algorithms course
- protect my shoulder's health - no archer push-ups today
- complete pull-up sets 
- tally complaints
- tally overconfidence
- tally speaking badly of others
- get to bed 10:30 latest
