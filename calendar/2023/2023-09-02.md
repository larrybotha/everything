## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to enjoy things like having ice baths
- being able to meet and enjoy my time with new people
- being challenged by cognitively demanding work

### Today's efforts

- complete Rust chapter
- be present for my delicious meal at Bhakti
- do Yoga Nidra
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- replace the exercise I would get from surfing with something else
- go through Ali's trading spreadsheet with her

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- had a delicious smoothie at La Esquina Del Cafe
- had a delicious dinner at Bakhti
- had a delicious alfajor at La Tortuga
- taught Ali some fundamentals for trading that she didn't know
	- related to invalid critical assumptions covered in [[Cognitive Load Theory and its Applications for Learning]]
- fixed bugs in my implementation of the "bad date queue" methods in the [[Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists]]
- learnt that [[deque]] is a generalisation of queues 

### Things I could have done better

- been more cognizant of when others are frustrated not necessarily with me, but because they're dealing with internal conflict
- listened more carefully when people ask for explanations and I answer what I assume they're asking, instead of clarifying when I'm not sure

### Tomorrow's efforts

- be present during the hike 
- internalise lessons using Yoga Nidra
- complete Rust chapter
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
