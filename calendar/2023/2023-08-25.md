## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to go surfing
- being generally healthy
- being able to sleep mostly well

### Today's efforts

- email Servientrega
- do Yoga Nidra after studying
- do 1 Rust section
- summarise 2 sections in Huberman Lab podcast
- prepare appointment model for refactoring
- refactoring 2 legacy groups

## Evening Summary

Read Josh Kaufman's [[Iteration Cycles]] article - the acronym seemed forced and disjoint from what each item was suggesting. A more applicable and meaningful approach may be to consider the [[DevOps Lifecycle]] and apply its principles more generally outside of software development

Realised that perhaps a decent way to get into creating development videos is to do short videos describing what abstractions are doing under the hood, e.g. Rust's [[std..option..Option..take]] vs [[std..mem..replace]], how JavaScript's `Array.map` contrasts with a loop

### Things that went well

- completed Rust chapter
- did appointment migrations
- removed 3 legacy groups
- made avo ice cream
- had a delicious dinner
- Ali found a highly rated pizzeria that we'll go to tomorrow
- did Yoga Nidra
- added some Rust notes for things I didn't previously quite grasp

### Things I could have done better

- identified that a YouTube video was click bait by title, and instead meditated as I intended
- been cognizant of the opportunity cost in reading the comments section of the video, and then spent my time better elsewhere
- didn't complete any Andrew Huberman podcast summarising - was too optimistic about available time
- didn't email Servientrega - chose to spend my time reading, learning, or writin

### Tomorrow's efforts

- surf in the morning
- eat pizza
- join Fran and Julz for her birthday
- complete 1 Rust section
- do shopping
- summarise 1 section in Huberman Lab podcast
