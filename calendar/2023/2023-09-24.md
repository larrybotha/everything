## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- not having to live in a city like Guayaquil
- having the health to walk and sightsee
- being able to sleep well

### Today's efforts

- find out about next appointment for aligners
- respond to Jason
- get credit card stuff up to date
- complete Rust section
- complete lambda calculus recursion chapter
- do Yoga Nidra

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- worked out some critical fundamental concepts in Rust
- had a healthy lunch and dinner
- had a nice walk on the promenade
- did Yoga Nidra and had a nap
- contacted Jason and Rolandi

### Things I could have done better

- wasted a lot of time scrolling Twitter looking at morbid videos of Guayaquil - that time could have been much better spent doing Rust or lambda calculus
- gone to bed earlier

### Tomorrow's efforts

- allow for selecting location for grid
- scope appointment search to location
- scope day sheet to location
- do 1 section of Rust
- complete recursion in lambda calculus
- acknowledge quickly when wasting time on social media / news, and move to something productive
- work out if Servientrega can deliver to Panam√°
- be aware of potential credit spreads on SPX
