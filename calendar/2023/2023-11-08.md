### Today's efforts

- 

## Evening Summary

- feeling exceptionally frustrated. Ongoing uncertainty about options trading, although warranted, is grinding me down. I need to study my course material deeply, but also need to progress my career. There's always something pulling me in one way or another. Need to get back into a good sleep habit

### Things that went well

- refactored an immense amount of technical debt
- simplified a highly complex component
- started variable resistance training

### Things I could have done better

- not gone to bed late the night before and woken up late this morning
- not gone to bed late tonight
- been more patient
- ensured that I studied Rust - opportunity cost - every day is one day further from freedom
- didn't call hair salon
- didn't follow through with Niksa 

### Tomorrow's efforts

- complete 5 sections of Rustlings
- refactor view for updating resources
- complete view for deleting annotation templates
- avoid social media
- get up at 7:30, no matter what
- tally complaints
- summarise takeaways from X3 article
