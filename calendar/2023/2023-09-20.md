## Evening Summary

Walked on North Seymour Island this morning at 6am - we saw blue footed boobies, Magnificent Frigates with their pouches expanded, Great Frigate chicks with their first heads, a sad Galapagos Sea Lion calling over her still-born infant, and Frigates pulling a Swallowtail Gull away from its nest by its wing

Had delicious hot chocolate and coffee at breakfast
