## Morning

- send invoice and tracking number to Servientrega if available
- surf
- complete 3 legacy group migrations
- complete remaining sections of Rust tutorial chapter
- write notes for Huberman Lab podcast episodes
- message Joy

### I'm grateful for...

- having the finances and [[resilience]] to handle surprise payments like my expensive delivery from South Africa
- being able to go out and surf after work, even if the conditions are not great
- have the capability to control my finances

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- messaged Joy
- completed Rust chapter and understood what was going on
- surfed
- refactored the crap out of a complicated view in the application
- fixed a few bugs users raised or reported
- made a number of performance improvements to the application
- rolled trades that had reached their profit thresholds
- added a bunch of useful information to Obsidian

### Things I could have done better

- put more effort into completing the tasks I set out to for work - much of what I did was tangential to what I'm currently attempting to complete
- was audibly frustrated with loud vehicles in the adjacent road - I cannot control the vehicles, they are outside of the locus of my control, but I can control how I respond to them
- didn't complete any notes for the the Huberman Lab podcasts - overestimated how much I could get done today

### Tomorrow's tasks

- complete next Rust tutorial chapter
- add notes of the critical ideas in the first 3 Huberman Lab podcasts - the next episode is already full of actionable information and it'll be massively useful to incorporate this stuff into Obsidian, and into my behaviour
- surf
- email Isabelle
- email Kramer and Kramer about selling LLC
- evaluate changing flights and accommodation to Quito
