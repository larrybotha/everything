## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to sleep when there's noise outside
- being able to go surfing at the end of a work day
- being able to work on challenging things

### Today's efforts

- complete 3 legacy migrations
- complete Rust tutorial section
- summarise 2 Huberman Lab sections
- do Yoga Nidra
- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening

## Evening Summary

Chris used an `if` statement to get a value from a class, when he could have used `getattr`. This is one of the abstractions that could fit well in a series of videos on how things work in terms of their underlying mechanics

### Things that went well

- refactored 2 legacy groups
- moved view to correct folder
- started refactoring overly complex logic for reserving appointment time slots
- visualised pop-ups this morning and evening
- bought electric blanket for mother
- paid DHL for shipment
- summarised Scott Young's article on the 85% rule for learning

### Things I could have done better

- broken down the complex logic into its core responsibilities on paper before attempting to dive into the code

### Tomorrow's efforts

- visualise pop-ups in the morning and evening
- be cognizant of frustration when surfing, and actively calm myself
- check DHL delivery status
- roll trades if need be
- complete 1 legacy migration
- simplify appointment reservations
- simplify appointment time slot creation
- use Yoga Nidra to solidify learning
