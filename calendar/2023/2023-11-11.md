## Evening Summary

- surfing hurts your feet of you don't lift your leading foot enough when popping up
	- practice pop-ups on land!
- verbalising prioritisation of tasks is somewhat satisfying when the tasks are completed in that order

### Things that went well

- surfed
- had a nice dinner with Jane
- made some fundamental realisations about Rust 
- completed a number of sections in Rustlings
- bought a number of things we need around the house

### Things I could have done better

- spoken up when speaking to Lynn - she is struggling to hear

### Tomorrow's efforts

- complete 5 Rustlings sections
- add cards to Stokard
- surf if Ali is healthy enough to
- be present
- tally complaints
- lash the dowel sticks onto my pull up bar
- complete a full set of VRT exercises
- get to bed no later than 10:30
- plan for a week of getting up early enough to surf
