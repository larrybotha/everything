## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being cooked delicious food for while on holiday
- having good company when on holiday 

### Today's efforts

- be thoughtful of others
- be present
- speak only positively of others
- do Yoga Nidra
- add 5 notes on lambda calculus
- acknowledge that feeling frustrated is likely as a result of exhaustion

## Evening Summary

Snorkelled in Buccaneer Bay and saw +-5 White-Tipped Reef Sharks, among many other fish, and swam with playful sea lions

We walked on Bartolomé and Juan described the intense Mars-like landscape

Luis, the cook on The Beluga, made a delicious chocolate and Oreo ice cream. Also made a massive meal with options for beef, chicken, tuna, and ceviche, in addition to delicious veggies and a number of sauces

### Things that went well

- swam with sharks in Buccaneer Bay
- snorkelled around Pinnacle Rock in Bartolomé
- had delicious dinner
- walked in volcanic landscapes

### Things I could have done better

- been less people-pleasing when unsure what to say
	- what strategies can I develop to help cope with situations where I end up needlessly complimenting people and things?

### Tomorrow's efforts

- visualise pop-ups
- do Yoga Nidra
- add 5 lambda calculus notes
- contact Matt about new board and wetsuit
- prepare food for the week
- be present
- get to bed no later than 10:30
