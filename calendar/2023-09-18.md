## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- saw a Galapagos snake sunbathing near the marine iguanas
- walked along volcanic formations on a beach
- saw a sunfish while snorkelling
- snorkeled with enormous turtles
- saw a huge shoal of fish while snorkelling

### Things I could have done better

- been less reactive when considering whether or not to take part in an activity that hurt my back that others could enjoy
- consider that perhaps the pain I felt from the activity is potentially as a result of my technique, rather than simply "pain" in my back
- be aware that my inclination when I'm unsure of what to say is to go for praise of something, which likely comes across as people-pleasing

### Tomorrow's efforts

- be thoughtful of others
- be present
- speak only positively of others
- do Yoga Nidra
- add 5 notes on lambda calculus
- acknowledge that feeling frustrated is likely as a result of exhaustion
