## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- had a rad day with friends from Australia, the UK, and at my mom's
- avoided eating meat even though I cooked it all
- did some Rust
- on my last set of aligners

### Things I could have done better

- ensured I had enough sleep the nights before - my 1pm internet binge on Friday ended up making me sluggish and lethargic today when spending time with friends I hadn't seen in years. The opportunity cost of wasting time has impacts days, weeks, months, and years later. Protect your time

- complete treatment setup refactorings
- resolve 2 legacy groups
- get early morning sunlight
