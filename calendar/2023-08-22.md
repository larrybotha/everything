## Morning Summary

### I'm grateful for...

- being able to sit out in the morning sun after I wake up
- being able to benefit from Yoga Nidra via the internet
- having access to fresh produce so that we can eat healthily

### Today's efforts

- complete 3 legacy group refactorings
- surf 2 hours
- complete 1 Rust tutorial section
- follow up with Yoga Nidra
- send tracking number to Servientrega

## Evening Summary

### Things that went well

- fixed a number of bugs
- resolved 2 legacy groups
- migrated a number of fields
- surfed
- did some Rust

### Things I could have done better

- not pointed out someone else's potential shortcomings in relation to my own. I don't know what's going on in other people's minds, and comparing them to myself is passive aggressive
- not become emotional when recounting someone else's story that I found insightful is met with criticism:
  - expect that some people's default response is critical, potentially out of habit, self preservation, or some other factor outside of my control
  - preamble the story in a manner that indicates that there is more context than what can be conveyed

### Tomorrow's efforts

- complete 3 legacy groups
- prepare issue for next major migration
- complete 2 Rust sections
- do Yoga Nidra after learning
- send tracking number to Servientrega
