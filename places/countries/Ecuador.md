There's someone selling chocolate, cacao, and other sweets upstairs in [Mercado 10 de agosto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P24fnJsugnskf61d7) - their cacao nibs are delicious and bitter. Delicious dried corn next door to her

The walking tour was great - in addition to the history of the buildings and the Spanish presence, the guide went into detail about the current political plight in Ecuador and where the violence stems from. Very insightful. 

There are nuns who sell things through revolving doors and haven't seen any other people in decades. They sell some kind of jelly or jam made from the cartilage of baby pigeons
