- While seated, the elbow rests on the knee (**A1**), the forearm is moved from a horizontal position to a vertical position (**A2**). 
	- Purpose: external rotator strengthening. 
- Lying on one side with a straightened leg, the upper leg has the knee flexed in 90° (**B1**). A circular movement is made with the upper arm while attempting to keep the thumb in contact with the floor until 180° of shoulder extension is reached (**B3**). The elbow should remain extended. 
	- Purpose: increasing shoulder mobility. 
- While lying down in prone position, slightly extend the lower spine (like the paddle position on a surf board). Starting with the arms in 90° abduction (**C1**), the elbows are pulled down so the arms are in 45° abduction (**C2**). This position may be advanced by adding some external rotation and retroflexion to reach a maximal downward rotation of the scapula and hence enhance scapular posterior tilt and downward rotation. The arms are then brought to 135° abduction (**C3**) and repositioned as in **C2** (**C4**). 
	- Purpose: scapular retraction training in combination with external rotator strengthening.

- While standing up straight, a stick is held to the thighs with the palms of the hands facing backwards (**A**). One arm is brought up (**B**, **C**) and behind the back (**D**). Then, the other arm is moved up (**E**) and brought forward (**F**). Repeat the exercise starting with the other arm.
	- Purpose: internal rotator stretches
