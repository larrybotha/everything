## takeaways

- people panic-sell shares during market crashes
	- do not do this
	- crashes don't matter if you hold shares in a broad-based ETF
	- buying protective PUTs is one way of managing emotions during a market crash

## Ch 5 - How PUTs work in a bear market

- the market generally goes up, so PUTs generally lose value
- during bear markets, Travis finds comfort inn seeing something go up while everything else goes down
	- what other strategies can one use in a bear market to mitigate frustration?
- PUTs don't replace the value of stocks 100%
- Travis uses protective PUTs primarily for minimising emotionally triggering events, such as a crash when the market may fall 30-50% - he never exercises them, because he intends on holding his stock for life
	- attentively, this could also be framed in 2 ways I can think of:
		- shares are on sale
		- market crashes are the best time to use Travis' Buffet Strategy
- Travis noticed that clients who had PUTs in place were less likely to sell
- the losses from PUTs can be offset by buying CALLs
	- PUTs don't seem to erode the full value of CALLs in null markets - to be validated: [[q - what are the outcomes for pairing PUTs and CALLs in different market conditions]]
- success in investing is not only about money - it's about managing emotions. That's what PUTs are for here
	- making too much can make one greedy
	- losing a ton of value in shares can make people panic sell
- takeaways:
	- panic-selling is bad for your portfolio
	- manage your emotions
	- buying PUTs against shares you own is a way of managing your emotions
