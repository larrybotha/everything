## The NVC process

- observations
	- develop the ability to articulate what you are observing the other is saying, but without introducing judgement or evaluation
- feelings
	- stating how you feel from what you've observed
- needs, values, or desires
	- expressing how one's needs are connected to those feelings
- requests
	- making a request given the observation, feelings, and needs, that would enrich your life if it were fulfilled

e.g. when I hear you say X, it makes me feel Y because I need / value Z. Would you be willing to do A?

The other part of this communication is receiving these 4 things from the other, so that they we may help them enrich their life

## communication that blocks compassion

### moralistic judgements

- the classification of things as good or bad
- analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.
- Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served - this is healthy
- we make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments - this blocks compassion
- classifying and judging people promotes violence

### making comparisons

- comparisons are a form of judgement
- compare one's self to others to see how miserable you can make yourself - now consider how comparing someone to another would make them feel

### denial of responsibility

- our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility for our feelings and thoughts
	- language that implies lack of choice usually indicates denial of responsibility
- we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute them to external causes
- we can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice

### other forms of life-alienating communication

- expressing desires as demands
	- a demand implicitly or explicitly threatens blame or punishment if there is a failure to comply
	- demands are in contrast to requests
- the concept that certain actions merit reward while others merit punishment
	- e.g. someone 'deserving' punishment
	- this thinking assumes goodness and badness in things

## observing without evaluating

- learn to separate observation from evaluation
- when we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism
- labels such as 'lazy' and 'stupid' have a negative connotation, but even neutral labels such as 'cook' can limit the totality of the perception of someone

### the highest form of intelligence

- being able to make observations without evaluation
- manifests as
	- a failure to describe what happened
	- making inferences
	- making interpretations

### distinguishing observations from evaluations

- use of the verb 'to be' without taking responsibility for the evaluation
	- e.g. you are X, vs, when I see you do Y, I think you are being X
- use of evaluative connotations
	- e.g. Sam procrastinates vs, Sam starts assignments with only a few days before submission
- implications that one's inferences of others are the only ones possible
	- e.g. you'll never be able to do X, vs I don't think you'll be able to do X
- confusing prediction with certainty
	- e.g. if you don't do X, Y will happen, vs if you don't do X, I fear that Y will happen
- failure to be specific
	- people of X culture are Y, vs I haven't seen the family at such-and-such place do Y activity
- words that denote ability without indicating an evaluation was made
	- e.g. he's a terrible goalie, vs he's conceded many goals this season
- using verbs and adjectives in ways that do not indicate an evaluation was made
	- e.g. Sam is unattractive, vs I am not attracted to Sam
