## The NVC process

- observations
	- develop the ability to articulate what you are observing the other is saying, but without introducing judgement or evaluation
- feelings
	- stating how you feel from what you've observed
- needs, values, or desires
	- expressing how one's needs are connected to those feelings
- requests
	- making a request given the observation, feelings, and needs, that would enrich your life if it were fulfilled

e.g. when I hear you say X, it makes me feel Y because I need / value Z. Would you be willing to do A?

The other part of this communication is receiving these 4 things from the other, so that they we may help them enrich their life

## communication that blocks compassion

### moralistic judgements

- the classification of things as good or bad
- analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values.
- Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served - this is healthy
- we make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments - this blocks compassion
- classifying and judging people promotes violence

### making comparisons

- comparisons are a form of judgement
- compare one's self to others to see how miserable you can make yourself - now consider how comparing someone to another would make them feel

### denial of responsibility

- our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility for our feelings and thoughts
	- language that implies lack of choice usually indicates denial of responsibility
- we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute them to external causes
- we can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice

### other forms of life-alienating communication

- expressing desires as demands
	- a demand implicitly or explicitly threatens blame or punishment if there is a failure to comply
	- demands are in contrast to requests
- the concept that certain actions merit reward while others merit punishment
	- e.g. someone 'deserving' punishment
	- this thinking assumes goodness and badness in things

## observing without evaluating

- learn to separate observation from evaluation
- when we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism
- labels such as 'lazy' and 'stupid' have a negative connotation, but even neutral labels such as 'cook' can limit the totality of the perception of someone

### the highest form of intelligence

- being able to make observations without evaluation
- manifests as
	- a failure to describe what happened
	- making inferences
	- making interpretations

### distinguishing observations from evaluations

- use of the verb 'to be' without taking responsibility for the evaluation
	- e.g. you are X, vs, when I see you do Y, I think you are being X
- use of evaluative connotations
	- e.g. Sam procrastinates vs, Sam starts assignments with only a few days before submission
- implications that one's inferences of others are the only ones possible
	- e.g. you'll never be able to do X, vs I don't think you'll be able to do X
- confusing prediction with certainty
	- e.g. if you don't do X, Y will happen, vs if you don't do X, I fear that Y will happen
- failure to be specific
	- people of X culture are Y, vs I haven't seen the family at such-and-such place do Y activity
- words that denote ability without indicating an evaluation was made
	- e.g. he's a terrible goalie, vs he's conceded many goals this season
- using verbs and adjectives in ways that do not indicate an evaluation was made
	- e.g. Sam is unattractive, vs I am not attracted to Sam

## identifying and expressing feelings

### the heavy cost of unexpressed feelings

- silence can indicate fear or anxiety
- breaking silence by expressing the associated feeling helps open up communication
- criticisms of others are often self-fulfilling - telling someone it's like speaking to a wall is likely to elicit more silence; the person being criticised is likely going to feel hurt and discouraged
- expressing vulnerability can help resolve conflicts

### feelings vs non-feelings

- if "I feel" can be replaced with "I think", then a thought is being expressed, not a feeling
- Words such as 'that', 'like', as 'if': 
	- “I feel that you should know better.”
	- “I feel like a failure.”
	- “I feel as if I’m living with a wall.”
- The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it: 
	- “I feel I am constantly on call.”
	- “I feel it is useless.”
- Names or nouns referring to people: 
	- “I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.”
	- “I feel my boss is being manipulative.”
- feelings can be expressed without using the word 'feel'
	- e.g. "I'm annoyed"
- we need to distinguish between feelings and what we think we are
	- "I feel like I'm not a good musician" vs "I feel disappointed in my skills as a musician"
- words like 'ignored', 'cornered', 'trapped' are interpretations of others actions
	- we feel 'hurt' or 'angry' when ignored
	- we feel 'anxious' or 'fearful' when cornered
	- we feel 'powerless' when we are trapped

### building a vocabulary for feelings

- 'good' or 'bad' to describe how one feels is vague and ambiguous, and prevent the listener from connecting
- different feelings are evoked depending on whether our needs are being met or not

## taking responsibility for our feelings

![[People are disturbed not by things, but by the...]]

### hearing a negative message: 4 options

- what others say and do is the stimulus, but not the cause of our feelings
- our feelings come from how we choose to receive what others say and do, in addition to our needs
- there are 4 ways we can respond:
	- take it personally by hearing blame and criticism
		- choosing this option and taking the blame comes at a cost to self-esteem, inclining one towards guilt, shame, and depression
	- blame others
		- a defensive or accusatory response is often accompanied by feeling anger
	- sense our own feelings or needs
		- when receiving a negative message, one may be inclined to reveal how the message makes one feel, and how it is associated to one's own needs
	- sense other's feelings or needs
		- shining a light on the other person's needs by asking if they are feeling emotion X because of need Y
- accept responsibility for one's own feelings, rather than blaming others
	- e.g. "You disappointed me when X," as opposed to, "I was disappointed when X, because I wanted to Y and Z"
- one can deepen their own sense of responsibility by making a habit of using the pattern "I feel [ some emotion ] when [ X happens ] because [ some need is not met ]"
- the mechanism of 'motivation by guilt' is to make the other person responsible for ones own emotions
	- complying here is an avoidance of guilt, not an act of the heart

### the needs at the root of feelings

- judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are all alienated expressions of our needs
- expressing one's needs via judgements often leads to the other interpreting it criticism
- criticism leads to defense or attack in order to protect one's self
- expressing one's needs is more effective in having them met than is passing judgement on another

### the pain of expressing our needs vs the pain of not expressing our needs

- if we don't value our needs, others are unlikely to, too

### from emotional slavery to emotional liberation

- in developing emotional liberation many of us go through 3 stages
	- emotional slavery, where we feel responsible for others' feelings
	- the obnoxious stage, where we feel angry, and no longer want to be responsible for others' feelings
	- emotional liberation; taking responsibility of both our intentions and actions
- at the 3rd stage is awareness that we cannot meet our own needs at the expense of others - stating clearly what we need communicates we are equally concerned that the needs of others' are fulfilled

### summary

- we have four options as to how to receive the message: 
	- blame ourselves
	- blame others
	- sense our own feelings and needs
	- sense the feelings and needs hidden in the other person’s negative message
- we generally move through stages in becoming emotionally liberated
	- emotional slavery
		- taking responsibility for others feelings
	- obnoxious
		- refusing to acknowledge what others feel or need
	- liberation
		- accepting responsibility for our own feelings, but not of others, while acknowledging that we cannot meet our own needs at the expense of others
