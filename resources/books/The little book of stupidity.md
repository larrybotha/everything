## Hell Mr Wheeler

- bank robber who was caught because he thought lemon juice would make his face invisible to cameras
- allegedly inspired Dunning and Kruger to begin their research


## anchoring

- makes one rely too heavily on the first piece of information, affecting subsequent decisions
- biggest impact is in situations where there was no prior knowledge of the information
- even knowing about anchoring doesn't prevent people from being subject to its effects
- focusing on a specific aspect of a situation to counter the effect can result in one becoming susceptible to another bias - focalism - a different distortion of our perception of the environment
- one manifestation of focalism is getting caught up in predictions of what will make us happy in future, resulting in a failure to see the current reality
- focusing on how bad a task is, only to realise after doing it that it's not that bad, is another manifestation of focalism

### cognitive bias

- the natural response to minimise cognitive dissonance
- smart people develop better mechanisms to defend poor ideas
- we have selective recall / access biased memory which exarcerbates confirmation bias
- information that doesn't match our views is harder to remember, or is completely ignored
- the emotional centers of the brain are activated when faced with contrary opinions
- attempts to "enlighten" people that hold erroneous beliefs are most likely to do one of two things:
	- nothing at all
	- bolster the erroneous beliefs, which is known as _entrenching_
- confirmation bias limits one's abilities to see alternatives
- anecdotal evidence taking precedence over statistical relevance is a manifestation of confirmation bias
- the use of historic cases in law introduces confirmation bias via anchoring
- confirmation bias is a building block for confidence - in children it gives them agency to explore
	- it's critical for development
	- overconfident kids attempt and say things that others don't, and as a result learn even more about the world
- as a way to improve self-awareness, in the face of contrary information, avoid the knee-jerk reaction of presenting evidence against the statement. Instead, acknowledge the neurological and physiological effects of cognitive dissonance, and the tendency to engage with information that confirms one's own bias
