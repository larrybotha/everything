## anchoring

- makes one rely too heavily on the first piece of information, affecting subsequent decisions
- biggest impact is in situations where there was no prior knowledge of the information
- even knowing about anchoring doesn't prevent people from being subject to its effects
- focusing on a specific aspect of a situation to counter the effect can result in one becoming susceptible to another bias - focalism - a different distortion of our perception of the environment
- one manifestation of focalism is getting caught up in predictions of what will make us happy in future, resulting in a failure to see the current reality
- focusing on how bad a task is, only to realise after doing it that it's not that bad, is another manifestation of focalism
