## Biases: an introduction by Rob Bensinger

- random error is akin to pulling balls from a jar containing red and white balls of different proportions
	- the more samples you take, the more you learn
	- the more you learn about random error, the fewer errors you'll make
- statistical bias is analagous to pulling balls from a jar containing red and white balls, but where the red balls are heavier and sink to the bottom
	- learning more in this environment doesn't necessarily mean you will make fewer errors - e.g. repeatedly pulling a misrepresentative number of balls due to weight
	- statistical bias skews a sample so that it is less representative of the population
- cognitive bias skews our beliefs so that 
	- they less accurately represent facts
	- our decision making limits us from reaching our goals
- hollywood rationality is often viewed as someone who is stern, hyperintellectual, stoic
	- e.g. Spock. Despite being rational, he was outmaneuvered by irrational / erratic behaviour
- rationality as studied in the sciences can be described as _doing the best with what you've got_
	- knowing when _not_ to overthink things is an important skill - overthinking can degrade performance, or reduce satisfaction of a choice
- rationality requires both fast and slow-thinking systems; emotions are critical
- we recognise biases in others, but fail to recognise our own - [[Bias blind spot]]
	- we tend to think we're more objective than others because we fail to identify when we are using biases
- studying biases can make one more susceptible to overconfidence and confirmation bias
- [[base rate neglect]] can be reduced by thinking of probabilities in terms of frequencies

### what do I mean by "rationality"?

- two types of rationality:
	- Epistemic rationality: systematically improving the accuracy of your beliefs.
	- Instrumental rationality: systematically achieving your values
- rationality is about forming true beliefs and making decisions that are in line with your values
- conjunction fallacy - believing that an event of higher complexity is more probable than a simpler one
	- i.e. P(A) >= P(A,B) - the probability of A alone is gte the probability A _and_ B

### feeling rational

- emotions rise from our models of reality
- "That which can be destroyed by the truth should be" - P.C. Hodgell
	- That which can be destroyed by the truth should be
- people are unsure of whether they should feel certain emotions, whether thinking rationally or not

### why truth? and...

- the fast-thinking system (often attributed to emotions) is not always false 
- the slow-thinking system (deliberate evaluation) is not always true
- both systems can help or hinder finding the truth
- people may seek truth for various reasons:
	- curiosity
	- utility
	- moral duty
- truth as a moral duty can be a slippery slope, as morals may be _learned_ or come from societal pressure, not necessarily the way thinks actually work
	- this is akin to tribal custom, and when shown as false, is less likely to be viewed as something to modify one's beliefs

### what's a bias, again?

- a bias is a kind of obstacle to the goal of finding the truth
	- not all obstacles are biases
- biases are distinct from adopted beliefs or moral duties, which are easier to correct than biases once noticed
	- these 'mistakes' in thinking may have a bias as their eventual source, however
### availability

- the [[availability heuristic]]
- selective reporting is a major source of availability biases
- [[absurdity bias]]
	- e.g. people refusing to buy flood insurance in flood areas because it's never happened to them
- a society used to regular minor hazards tends to treat those hazards as the upper bound
- memory is not a good guide to probabilities in the past

### burdensome details

- [[conjunction fallacy]] can make an outcome seem more plausible if a less plausible outcome is paired with a more plausible one
- more plausible does not necessarily mean more probable, and more information cannot make something more probable
- the word "and" should be a trigger to watch out for conjunction fallacy
- [[Occam's Razor]] is useful in mitigating the effect of conjunction fallacy

> There is no straw that lacks the power to break your back.
