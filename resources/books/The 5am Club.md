## Rules

1. An addiction to distraction is the end of your creative production. Empire
  makers and history creators take one hour for themselves before dawn, in the
  serenity that lies beyond the clutches of complexity, to prepare themselves
  for a world-class day.
2. Excuses breed no genius. Just because you haven't installed the
  early-rising habit before doesn't mean you can't do it now. Release your
  rationalizations and remember that small daily improvements, when done
  consistently over time, lead to stunning results.
3. All change is hard at first, messy in the middle, and gorgeous at the end.
  Everything you now find easy you first found difficult. With
  consistent practice, getting up with the sun will become your new normal. And
  automatic.
4. To have the results The Top 5% of producers have, you must start doing
  what 95% of people  re unwilling to do. As you start to live like this, the
  majority will call you crazy. Remember that being labelled a freak is the
  price of greatness.
5. When you feel like surrendering, continue. Triumph loves the relentless.
  - "Real riches come from living by the noble virtues of productivity,
    self-discipline, courage, honestly, empathy, and integrity as well as
    being able to lead your days on your own terms versus blindly following
    the sheep.
  - "Elite production without quiet vacation causes lasting depletion. Rest
    and recovery isn't a luxury for anyone committed to mastery - it's a
    necessity... I've also learned that inspiration gets fed by isolation,
    away from the ceaseless digital diversion and mindless overcommunication
    that dominates the hours of the majority of these days... Your natural
    genius presents itself when you're most joyful. We get our ideas that
    change the world when we're rested, relaxed and filled with delight.

## The 5 Scientific Truths Behind Excellent Habits:

1. World-class willpower isn't an inborn strength, but a skill developed
  through relentless practice. Getting up at dawn is the perfect
  self-controlling training.
2. Personal discipline is a muscle. The more you stretch it, the stronger it
  grows. Therefore, the samurais of self-regulation actively create conditions
  of hardship to build their natural power.
3. Like other muscles, willpower weakens when tired. Recovery is, therefore,
  absolutely necessary for the expression of mastery. And to manage decision
  fatigue.
4. Installing any great habit successfully follows a distinct 4-part pattern
  for automation of the routine. Follow it explicitly for lasting
  results.
5. Increasing self-control in one area of your life elevates self-control in
  all areas of your life. This is why joining The 5am Club is the same
  game-changing habit that will lift everything else that you do.

## The 3 Values of Heroic Habit-Makers

1. Victory demands consistency and persistency.
2. Following through on what is started determines the size of the personal
  respect that will be generated.
3. The way you practice in private is precisely the way you'll perform once
  you're in public
  - Successful people - "lies in fact that they formed the habit of doing
    things that failures don't like to do... Top producers make it a habit to
    do the high-value activities that average ones don't feel like doing -
    even when they, too, don't feel like doing them... And by practicing the
    desired behavior over and over, their self-mastery and personal
    discipline grows. And the new routine becomes automated."
  - "...will power weakens once it gets tired. Scientists call the condition
    "ego depletion." You wake up with a full battery of self-control. That's
    why I want you to do the activities that are most important to the rise
    of your inner empires at the time when your capacity is strongest - 5am.
    As you go through your day... your ability to self-regulate decreases -
    and so does your capability to handle temptations and manage weak
    impulses. The fact that human discipline muscles get tired from all the
    decision fatigue explains why so many massively successful people end up
    doing something foolish that destroys their careers.
  - "The best thinking has been done in solitude. The worst has been done in
    turmoil."

## The 10 Tactics of Lifelong Genius

1. The Tight Bubble of Total Focus (TBTF)
  - An addiction to distraction is the death of your creative production.
    Your attraction to digital interruption is costing you your fortune -
    financially, cognitively, energetically, physically, and spiritually.
    TBTF is a metaphor that you build around your assets of genius so they
    are not only strong they increase. The 5 primary assets that all
    super-producers defend are mental focus, physical energy, personal
    willpower, original talent, and daily time. The real key here is solitude
    for a scheduled period every day, in a positive environment that floods
    you with creativity, energy, happiness and the feeling the work you're
    doing is for the upliftment of humanity.
2. The 90/90/1 Rule
  - Doing real work, instead of artificial work, daily and with absolute
    consistency, will give you a gargantuan competitive advantage born of
    mastery. Legendary achievers concentrate all their attention and effort
    on one core project at a time so they harness the fullness of their
    cognitive capacity and their precious energy on releasing glorious
    products that turn their industry on their head. The 90min period must be
    completed free of any noise and interruptions.
3. The 60/10 Method
  - The way elite creatives do what they do is by understanding the power of
    oscillation. They structure their work cycles so they alternate bursts of
    deep focus and ferocious intensity of performance with periods of rest
    and full recovery. Even 10min of regeneration - go for a walk, meditate,
    read a book, so that your brain shifts from the worrying of behaviors of
    the left hemisphere into the creativity and flow of the right section.
4. The Daily 5 Concept
  - Studies show that the most effective business leaders are at their peak
    when they'v actively engaged their mindset on the progress they've made.
    Make consistent 1% wins and micro-achievements throughout each hour of
    your workday.
5. The 2nd Wind Workout (2WW)
  - Schedule a second workout at the end of each work day, you'll re-energize
    your willpower batteries so you improve your evening choices and even
    find your craving for sugar in the night time significantly lower. Go for
    a 1hr nature walk.
6. The 2 Massage Protocol (2MP)
  - Studies have shown that massage therapy is a modality that generates
    significant improvements to brain performance, mood, your ability to
    fight stress, and general wellness. 31% reduction in cortisol (fear
    hormone), 31% increase in dopamine (motivation), 28% elevation of
    seratonin (regulates anxiety and rising happiness), reduced muscle
    tension improved pain relief, and more mitochondria growth. So get 2
    90min massages per week
7. Traffic University
  - While your on your commute listen to audiobooks
8. The Dream Team Technique
  - Superproducers outsource and then automate all activities except those
    within the realm of their mastery, allowing for purity of focus and
    freeing up huge amounts of time.
9. The Weekly Design System (WDS)
  - Every Sunday take 30min to carve out your next week. Start by reflecting
    on the past week, the highlights, lessons learned, optimizations for the
    following week
10. The 60 Minute Student
  - Legendary leaders all have boundless curiosity and a limitless appetite
    to grow into their greatest selves. Peak producers are lifetime learners.
