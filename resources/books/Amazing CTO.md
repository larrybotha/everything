## rules
### Starts with a yes

- devs tend to say 'no' straight away, finding the holes in ideas first
- people don't want to hear flat out 'no's
- instead, embrace others ideas, and listen to what others have to say

### ask for help

- don't bang your head against a wall - find a friend, peer, mentor, or superior who can fast-track a solution

### 1:1s

- author calls them a superpower, never to be missed or rescheduled
- are about the employee
	- they are about people development, and where the employee wants to go
	- 3/4 for employee to talk, 1/4 for CTO
- approach:
	- 30 - 60m weekly
	- prepare decisions in 1:1s
	- tell employee what you're thinking
	- tell them what is coming
	- ask about what they are feeling
	- ask what they think about company announcement / strategy updates

### technology is about people

- technology choices are second to people
- people need:
	- to be aligned
	- to communicate
	- to understand each other
	- to work together
- people determine how good development is

### holds people accountable

- delegating tasks means clarifying quality and timing
- checkins with devs are scheduled according to experience level
	- e.g. twice a week with a junior, vs every 2 weeks with a manager
- juniors are held accountable for tasks, seniors for metrics
- delivery of results comes from a culture of accountability

### explains the world

- understanding the world makes people feel safe
	- why the company exists
	- what the company does 
	- where the company is going
	- why it is going there
- if things are not explained, someone is going to think they are going to be fired
- it is the manager's job to explain things to mitigate fear

### gives purpose

- people want to live in a context that has purpose
- this means explaining why the work needs to be done, and how it benefits others
- do not do work that has no purpose

### does not take shortcuts

- shortcuts are like sugar highs, and will come back to bite you

### is not defensive

- people have opinions, which may be anywhere on the spectrum of rightness or wrongness
- be open to opinions, weighing validity and criticisms of the opinion
