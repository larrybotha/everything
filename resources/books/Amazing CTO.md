## rules

### relax
#### Starts with a yes

- devs tend to say 'no' straight away, finding the holes in ideas first
- people don't want to hear flat out 'no's
- instead, embrace others ideas, and listen to what others have to say

#### ask for help

- don't bang your head against a wall - find a friend, peer, mentor, or superior who can fast-track a solution

#### 1:1s

- author calls them a superpower, never to be missed or rescheduled
- are about the employee
	- they are about people development, and where the employee wants to go
	- 3/4 for employee to talk, 1/4 for CTO
- approach:
	- 30 - 60m weekly
	- prepare decisions in 1:1s
	- tell employee what you're thinking
	- tell them what is coming
	- ask about what they are feeling
	- ask what they think about company announcement / strategy updates
- see [[1-on-1 questions]]

#### technology is about people

- technology choices are second to people
- people need:
	- to be aligned
	- to communicate
	- to understand each other
	- to work together
- people determine how good development is

#### holds people accountable

- delegating tasks means clarifying quality and timing
- checkins with devs are scheduled according to experience level
	- e.g. twice a week with a junior, vs every 2 weeks with a manager
- juniors are held accountable for tasks, seniors for metrics
- delivery of results comes from a culture of accountability

#### explains the world

- understanding the world makes people feel safe
	- why the company exists
	- what the company does 
	- where the company is going
	- why it is going there
- if things are not explained, someone is going to think they are going to be fired
- it is the manager's job to explain things to mitigate fear

#### gives purpose

- people want to live in a context that has purpose
- this means explaining why the work needs to be done, and how it benefits others
- do not do work that has no purpose

#### does not take shortcuts

- shortcuts are like sugar highs, and will come back to bite you

#### is not defensive

- people have opinions, which may be anywhere on the spectrum of rightness or wrongness
- be open to opinions, weighing validity and criticisms of the opinion

#### talks about expectations

- people don't end up doing what managers expect because many do not express what that is
- i.e.
	- how people should work together
	- what is expected from different roles
	- expectations of delegated tasks
	- agreed metrics
	- expectations when onboarding of new team members
	- what is expected for team members to be successful
	- tells superiors what is expected foe their role

#### has passion

- do not delegate everything that you are passionate about, otherwise the role will simply become a job
- people lose passion when they work on too many things that they are not passionate about
- keep looking for nee things to be passionate about

#### sets people up for success

- a common mistake is hiring for or delegating work where the person is set up to fail
- the primary approach should be "what can I do to prepare this person to succeed?"
- e.g. do they require
	- clarity on their role
	- authority
	- autonomy
	- budget
	- introductions

### land of confusion
### gets the cow off the ice first

- ignore where issues came from, etc - in an emergency, the priority is to do the thing that is most critical within that crisis first

### is not their tools

- do not let your tools define you
- if the tools make you effective, use them, otherwise change them
- if the tools don't fit the company, they are not the tools you need

### knows the business side

- no one outside your team cares what you know or don't know
- you are the bridge between technology and business - you make it easy for people to understand what technology does

### self-validates

- those who self-validate learn to grow
- questions to ask:
	- what am I doing well?
	- what am I not doing well?
	- where can I grow?
	- where did I go wrong?
	- what did I do well?
	- what could be done better?
- self-reflection helps combat impostor syndrome

### is not letting people wait

- being on time is important
- being late costs people and companies
- team members' time must be spent as efficiently as possible

### does not waste other people's time

- do not waste others' time with things one can answer by themselves
- be conscious of the work you create for others
- do not send people off on quests for things that don't make sense using vagueries

### lives up to commitments

- do not overcommit to placate demands - being unable to follow through erodes trust
- be frugal with commitments, but live up to them
- if you have no control over a commitment, or would be unable to keep it, say no

### delegates everything

- time is precious - you work on the most important things with the biggest impact. See the [[Delegation checklist]]
- delegate as follows
	- tasks to juniors
	- features to devs
	- projects to senior devs
	- goals to leads
- there is a difference between the solution in one's head and that delivered by others
- judgement is based on the merits of the solution, not how it compares to yours
- communicate in expectations
- delegate for people to reduce your work, for them to shine, grow, and be exposed to new things
- delegate in such a way that authority is transferred, and that it's communicated to those who need to know
- the 'delegation vicious cycle' indicates that problems you don't delegate or don't care to delegate become your problem, expanding your responsibilities
	- there is work you cannot delegate; don't add to that work that you should delegate

#### recruits themself

- the professional has interviewed every person in their department
- the CTO has the final say on every hire

#### cares about bugs

- bugs are a distraction, and disturb workflows - they have a cost opportunity
- bugs are squashed as quickly as possible, otherwise they can easily get out of hand and overwhelm a team
- caring about bugs creates a culture of ownership, responsibility, and quality
- quality leads to craftsmanship, which makes people proud of what they do

#### is listening

- too few people listen to others - people want to be heard
- listen to everyone in the room
- talk less, listen more

#### works on things with impact

- focus on things that move the needle; things that transform the product and the company

#### is focused

- there will always be competing topics that need attention
- a manager is always served more than they can eat - it is for them to decide what to work on
- focus means deciding what to work on and what not to work on
- focus on delivering impact

#### knows the why

- always know why something is being
- the team also needs to always know why something is being done

#### is inclusive

- you have to foster a culture where everyone is welcome
- an inclusive culture is more fair, more innovative, is more performant, and is more fun
### running up that hill

#### is prepared for a meeting
