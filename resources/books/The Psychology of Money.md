## 1. No one's crazy

![[Your personal experiences with money...]]

- people act based on experience
- avoid judging others based on your experiences

## 2. Luck and risk

- nothing is as good or bad as it seems
- luck and risk don't tend to fit the stories we'd like to tell

## 3. Never enough

- not being able to recognise when you have enough puts you at risk for having nothing

## 4. Confounding compounding

- at the time of writing the book (2020), Buffet had $84.5b. $81.5 of that came after his 65th birthday
- investing done well should be boring
- the chief ingredient of portfolio growth is time 

## 5. Getting wealthy vs staying wealthy

![[Good investing is not necessarily about...]]

- being financially unbreakable is more important than big return
- being unbreakable allows you to stick around long enough for compounding to generate make big returns


## 6. Tails, you win 

![[You can be wrong half the time and still...]]

- events that occur in the long tail of distributions can have outsized impact
- a small number of events can account for the majority of gains 
- [[Nassim Taleb]] speaks a lot about the power of events that occur in the long tail of distributions - he benefited massively from 3 separate market crashes. See [[Black Swan Event]]

## 7. Freedom 

![[Controlling your time is the highest...]]

- happiness is complicated, and personal
- a universal aspect of happiness is people wanting to control their own lives 
- money is a mechanism that allows people to control their own lives

## 8. The "man in the car+ paradox

![[No one is as impressed with your possessions...]]

- the people who drive fancy cars are irrelevant - observers are more interested in driving the car than who the driver is
- your possessions are more impressive to you than to anyone else

## 9. Wealth is what you don't see

![[Spending money to show people how much money you have is...]]

- spending money on expensive things can make you feel rich
- spending money on expensive things is the fastest way to not be rich

## 10. Save money

- raising your humility can increase your wealth faster than raising your salary
- don't spend money to show you have wealth 
- savings = income - ego

## 11. Reasonable > rational

- aiming to be mostly reasonable is more effective than trying to be always rational
- spreadsheets outline an ideal strategy, but may not be reasonable for someone to stick to

## 12. Surprise!

![[History is the study of change, ironically used...]]

- things that have "never happened before" happen all the time
- history is mostly the study of surprising things

## 13. Room for error

![[The most important part of every plan is...]]

- margin of safety / room for error is the only way to navigate a world governed by odds
- the world is not governed by certainties

## 14. You'll change 

- long-term planning is difficult - people change, and their priorities change
- people are poor forecasters of their futures selves
- imagining goals is fun. Imagining goals within the context of realistic life stressors is another story

## 15. Nothing's free 

![[Everything has a price, but...]]

- everything has an [[Opportunity cost]]
- reframe losses from market fluctuations as an admission fee

## 16. You and me

- beware taking financial advice from people playing a different have to you
- consider financial advice in the context of the other's goals
- people have different risk parameters
	- none at all
	- make a quick buck
	- make market returns 
	- etc.
- copying someone with a different time horizon can be risky

## 17. The seduction of pessimism 

![[Optimism sounds like a sales pitch...]]

- the world tends to get better for most people most of the time
- progress happens too slowly for people to notice, but setbacks are hard to ignore
- optimism is a better long-term strategy than pessimism
- pessimism is easier to latch onto than optimism

## 18. When you'll believe anything

![[We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so...]]

- people generally find stories more appealing than statistics
- trying to make sense of the world can lead to mistakes
- respect the mess - the universe tends towards chaos - [[entropy]]
