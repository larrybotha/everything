## high performance leadership and management

- ING insights
	- they rely on small teams to achieve certain goals. Each team has a product owner who manages achieving the outcome. When the outcome is achieved, the team is disbanded
	- teams have mixed sets of skills
	- chapters categorise skills, e.g. a team may have a dba, a few devs, and a devops person - this can be visualised in a 2 dimensional array of teams on the x-axis, and chapters on the y-axis, with individuals represented by cells
	- a culture of learning and sharing of knowledge helps mitigate reliance on specific individuals for certain tasks

- develop and maintain the right mindset
	- learning and creating an environment of shared organisational learning, as opposed to only doing the work or the use of tools to do work
- make it your own
	- study and learn how other orgs use practices to improve their knowledge sharing and workflows, but don't just copy them - this is a process that should evolve organically from your teams
	- delegation to a consultancy will make your team feel like these changes are being done _to_ them - it must happen from within
	- develop coaches who will help sustain and develop this culture
- generative culture means everyone needs to change the way they work - it is not delegation to less senior employees
- ongoing change takes discipline and resilience
- change takes time - patience is required to effect change of entrenched workflows
- learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust repeat

## conclusion

the ability to deliver quality software at high tempo with stability is a key value driver and differentiator for all organizations, regardless of size or industry vertical

## capabilities to drive improvement

- **continuous delivery**
	- use version control for all production assets
	- automate your deployment process
	- implement continuous integration
		- check-in code regularly
		- check-ins trigger tests
		- deployable artifacts are created
	- use trunk-based development methods
		- branches have short lifetimes, usually less than a day
		- no code locks
	- implement test automation
		- tests are run automatically throughout the development process
	- support test data management
	- shift left on security
		- conduct security reviews of changes
		- include infosec team in design
		- use pre-approved security libs and packages
		- automated testing of security features
	- implement continuous delivery
		- production artifacts are deployable at any time
- **architecture capabilities**
	- use a loosely coupled architecture
		- i.e. teams can deploy and test applications without orchestration from other services
		- teams can work independently without relying on other teams
	- architect for empowered teams
		- allow teams to choose their own tools
- **product and process capabilities**
	- gather and implement user feedback
	- make the flow of work visible through the value stream
		- teams should be able to understand and see the flow of work from the business to the users, including status of products and features
	- work in small batches
		- short lead times and fast feedback loops
	- foster and enable team experimentation
- **lean management and monitoring capabilities**
	- a lightweight change approval process
		- at least one of pair programming or internal code review
	- monitor across application and infrastructure to inform business decisions
	- check system health proactively
	- improve processes and manage work with WIP limits
	- visualise work to monitor quality and communicate through the team
		- dashboards, internal websites, etc. improve software delivery performance
- **cultural capabilities**
	- support a generative culture
