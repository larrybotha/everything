- ING insights
	- they rely on small teams to achieve certain goals. Each team has a product owner who manages achieving the outcome. When the outcome is achieved, the team is disbanded
	- teams have mixed sets of skills
	- chapters categorise skills, e.g. a team may have a dba, a few devs, and a devops person - this can be visualised in a 2 dimensional array of teams on the x-axis, and chapters on the y-axis, with individuals represented by cells
	- a culture of learning and sharing of knowledge helps mitigate reliance on specific individuals for certain tasks

- develop and maintain the right mindset
	- learning and creating an environment of shared organisational learning, as opposed to only doing the work or the use of tools to do work
- make it your own
	- study and learn how other orgs use practices to improve their knowledge sharing and workflows, but don't just copy them - this is a process that should evolve organically from your teams
	- delegation to a consultancy will make your team feel like these changes are being done _to_ them - it must happen from within
	- develop coaches who will help sustain and develop this culture
- generative culture means everyone needs to change the way they work - it is not delegation to less senior employees
- ongoing change takes discipline and resilience
- change takes time - patience is required to effect change of entrenched workflows
- learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust repeat

- **continuous delivery**
	- use version control for all production assets
	- automate your deployment process
	- implement continuous integration
		- check-in code regularly
		- check-ins trigger tests
		- deployable artifacts are created
	- use trunk-based development methods
		- branches have short lifetimes, usually less than a day
		- no code locks
	- implement test automation
		- tests are run automatically throughout the development process
	- support test data management
	- shift left on security
		- conduct security reviews of changes
		- include infosec team in design
		- use pre-approved security libs and packages
		- automated testing of security features
	- implement continuous delivery
		- production artifacts are deployable at any time
- **architecture capabilities**
	- use a loosely coupled architecture
		- i.e. teams can deploy and test applications without orchestration from other services
		- teams can work independently without relying on other teams
	- architect for empowered teams
		- allow teams to choose their own tools
- **product and process capabilities**
	- gather and implement user feedback
	- make the flow of work visible through the value stream
		- teams should be able to understand and see the flow of work from the business to the users, including status of products and features
	- work in small batches
		- short lead times and fast feedback loops
	- foster and enable team experimentation
- **lean management and monitoring capabilities**
	- a lightweight change approval process
		- at least one of pair programming or internal code review
	- monitor across application and infrastructure to inform business decisions
	- check system health proactively
	- improve processes and manage work with WIP limits
	- visualise work to monitor quality and communicate through the team
		- dashboards, internal websites, etc. improve software delivery performance
- **cultural capabilities**
	- support a generative culture
		- good information flow
		- high cooperation and trust
		- bridging between teams
		- conscious inquiry
	- encourage and support learning
		- is learning considered essential for continued progress?
		- is learning thought of as a cost or investment?
	- support and facilitate collaboration amongst teams
		- how well do dev, ops, and infosec interact?
	- provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
		- doing work that is challenging and meaningful
		- being empowered to exercise your skills and judgement
		- being given the resources to do your job well
	- support or embody transformational leadership
		- support and amplify technical and process work that is essential for devops
		- five factors to embody:
			- vision
			- intellectual stimulation
			- inspirational communication
			- supportive leadership
			- personal recognition
## appendix B

### organisational performance

- high performers are 2x more likely to exceed organisational goals than are low performers
- high performers are 2x more likely to exceed non-commercial performance goals than are low performers: 
	- quantity and quality of products/services
	- operating efficiency
	- customer satisfaction
	- achieving org goals/mission

### software delivery performance

- there are 4 measures:
	- deploy frequency
		- highly correlated with continuous delivery and comprehensive use f version control
	- lead time
		- highly correlates with version control and automated testing
	- mean time to restore
		- highly correlated with version control and monitoring
	- change fail percentage
- there are no trade-offs between improving performance and achieving higher levels of tempo and and stability
- software delivery performance predicts organisational performance and non-commercial performance
- software delivery performance is negatively correlated with deployment pain. The poorer deployments are, the poorer the delivery performance and the culture

### quality

- unplanned work and rework
	- high performers report spending the least amount of time compared to medium and low performers doing this work
- manual work
	- high performers report the lowest amount of manual work across config management, testing, deployments, and change approval

### burnout and deployment pain

- deployment pain is negatively correlated with delivery performance and Westrum organisational culture
- the five factors most highly correlated with burnout are 
	- Westrum organizational culture (negative)
	- leaders (negative)
	- organisational investment (negative)
	- organisational performance (negative)
	- deployment pain (positive)

### technical capabilities

- i.e. test automation, deployment automation, trunk-based development, shift left on security, loosely coupled architecture, empowered teams, continuous integration
- trunk-based development
	- short-lived branches, usually a few hours or a day
- high performers spend 50% less time on resolving security issues than do low performers

### architecture capabilities

- on teams who deploy at least once per day, high performers deploy at significantly increased velocity as their team grows
- high-performing teams were more likely to respond positively to the following statements:
	- we can do most of our testing without requiring an integrated environment
	- we can and do deploy/release our applications independently of other applications/services they depend on
	- it is custom software that uses a microservices architecture

### lean management capabilities

- lean management capabilities predict 
	- Westrum organizational culture
	- job satisfaction
	- software delivery performance
	- less burnout
- Change approvals
	- approval only for high-risk changes was not correlated with software delivery performance
	- no approval process or peer review achieve higher software delivery performance
	- a lightweight change approval process predicts software delivery performance

### lean product management capabilities

- i.e. working in small batches, team experimentation, gathering and implementing customer feedback
- an experimental approach to product development is highly correlated with the technical practices that contribute to continuous delivery

### organisational culture capabilities

- the following are strongly correlated with culture
	- organizational investment in DevOps
	- the experience and effectiveness of team leaders
	- continuous delivery capabilities
	- the ability of development, operations, and infosec teams to achieve win-win outcomes
	- organizational performance
	- deployment pain
	- lean management practices

### identity, employee net promoter score, and job satisfaction

- identity predicts organisational performance
- high performers have better employee loyalty
- eNPS is significantly correlated with: 
	- the extent that user feedback is gathered and used to inform product decisions
	- the ability for team members to visualise and understand the flow of products and features through development all the way to customers
	- the extent to which employees identify with the organisation's values
- job satisfaction predicts organisational performance

### leadership

- high performing teams report having leaders with the strongest behaviours across these dimensions:
	- vision
	- inspirational communication
	- intellectual stimulation
	- supportive leadership
	- personal recognition
- characteristics of transformational leadership are highly correlated with software delivery performance
