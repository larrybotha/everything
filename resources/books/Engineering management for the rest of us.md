## ch 1

### caring for your team

- the work of a manager is to enable everyone around you
- this requires managers to embrace interruption-driven work, which requires a lot of collaboration and communication, in order to allow their team to enjoy flow-driven work
- engineering managers have experience they can impart on team members, but their most important tasks are:
	- making sure each team member understands why their work is important
	- helping each team member with what their career trajectory looks like
- engineering managers' scope of responsibilities extends beyond the impact of their code:
	- they impact the lives of their team members directly
- requires understanding 
	- power imbalances
	- people structures
	- strategies outside of the project
- bad managers are flippant about their responsibilities and consequences of their decisions - this job requires caring for team members in order to do it well

## ch 2

- values are the beliefs that guide and motivate us, and determine our actions
- the values people hold are a fundamental aspect of understanding how to work with groups of people
- an individual's values help one to understand what drives and motivates that person
- values dictate a person's actions and ethics
- NLP suggests considering motivations for people's actions - values determine what those actions are, and a person's history plays a large role in the values they have developed
	- i.e. they provide context to actions
- understanding values is important in helping team members understand each other, and helps build trust and vulnerability in the team
- values exercise:
	- build a list of values
	- have each team member choose 5 that resonate with them
	- have each team member chat about why they resonate with those values
	- team leader should start if the team is shy
- if there are trust issues and it feels uncomfortable to do this exercise, it's potentially more valuable for the team
- without understanding the values of others, one can be bound by their own context and limitations
- people may be misaligned in their values, e.g. Sam doesn't want people to speak badly of them, but will speak badly of others (integrity misaligned)
	- pointing the issue out is harmful, and is weaponising the person's values against them - don't do this
	- instead, focus on hearing the feelings and needs behind the message

### your own values

- understanding one's own values helps to shoe areas in our lives where we felt aligned, and contrast them with times where things didn't feel right
	- one's values can be evaluated in interactions with others - why do we find some people compelling, while others we find irritating?
	- how does one's values affect leadership style?
	- 

### company values

- companies have values, too, and need to align, at least partially, with your own
- they may be documented, or elicited more subtly via priorities, communication, and organisational structure
- e.g.
	- at Rackspace "fanatical support in all we do.’"
	- at Netlify "The best idea can come from anywhere."
- good company values convey a viewpoint that can be easily understood and checked against
- they should make it clear what the driving forces in the organisation are

### team values

- Sarah creates a list for every org she joins
- these are things that are important to the team, but not necessarily the org as a whole
- e.g.
	- We celebrate everyone’s wins as though they’re our own.
	- No compare and despair.
	- Be empowered to forge forward, we hired you because you’re an expert.
	- Make mistakes.
	- Choose impact over butts in seats (We’re not counting hours here, focus on making an impact and work when and how you want).
- these should be built by the team, and adapted as values change
- it's ok for people not to align with a team's values - other teams will have other values
- misalignment leads to burnout

### values and boundaries

- values need to be identified and protected
- misalignment leads to burnout, and it happens incrementally
- living incongruently with your values is unsustainable; the same applies if your team is expected to operate incongruently with the team's values or their own
- one needs to pay attention:
	- one's own values and inconsistencies with work
	- make sure on a daily basis not to violate the values of team members
- when conducting team values exercises:
	- take notes for yourself about what team members identify as important for themselves
	- when they set bundaries, attempt to identify the underlying value driving the boundary
	- find values that overlap, intersect, or have gaps
- values exercises are importanrt for:
	- feedback
	- managing conflicts
	- 1:1s
	- prioritisation
- good managers care for and appreciate people's values, and respect boundaries

## ch 3

### our jobs as managers

- a manager's job is to enable the people around you to do the best work together
	- meet people where they are, support them, nurture their development
	- consider the people adjacent to your team, and those adjacent to them
	- people are ideally operating in the intersection of what they're good at, enjoy, and what is good for the company

### trust and vulnerability

- mission-driven and high trust teams have the lowest number of outages and highest performance
- required for:
	- debating approaches openly
	- acknowledging and being accountable for mistakes
	- freedom to be creative
	- job happiness

### modeling vulnerability

- lead by example - it's easier for others to trust and show vulnerability if it comes from higher up first
	- admit when you're having a bad day, own up to mistakes, acknowledge not knowing something
### individual trust

- when you force yourself out of small talk and into subjects that matter to you, people tend to build trust faster
	- from a study by Matthias R. Mehl, et al., titled “Eavesdropping on Happiness: Well-Being is Related to Having Less Small Talk and More Substantive Conversations"
- humour is a good way to build trust and allow for mutual vulnerability
- someone who has been mistreated on teams previously may have greater trust issues
	- you may need to show vulnerability first to help them open up
	- find out what's important to them - their values
	- watch their interactions with others on the team
	- if issues arise, try to adjust processes around the team, rather than imposing them when trust is still being built
		- overworked, working on stuff that's not meaningful, lacking clarity on what needs to be done - alleviate these issues for them
- show that you can be trusted by taking action, rather than trying to convince through words
- think of what the person enjoys doing and what is beneficial to the companies as a venn diagram, where most of the effort should lie in the intersection
- as a manager, building trust needs to matter 
	- understanding values and boundaries is always the first step
		- where are they coming from?
		- what can be done to support their boundaries?
		- does the team support their values, or is there misalignment?

### team trust

- a trusting team has the following qualities:
	- easily bring up issues directly with each other
	- easily share personal details with each other, e.g. having a bad day
	- can debate with each other to find good outcomes
	- flexible with each others needs
- a more positive environment can be created by nudging team members to bring up issues in team meetings or in 1:1s with each other rather than with you directly

### weekly team time

- it's a mistake for managers not to meet with teams
- teams need to meet regularly to:
	- talk through work
	- discuss issues
	- just hang out
- in a study on living in apartments, proximity was shown to be a critical component of building trust
	- Social Pressures in Informal Groups: A Study of Human Factors in Housing by authors Festinger, Schachter, and Back

### building trust across the team

- team members may want to build trust with you, but not the team - this may feel good, but the goal is for everyone to build trust together
- issues between team members should be brought into the open in a safe environment with the goal of the team being able to build trust together
- recommendations for team meetings:
	- recommended 2 meetings per week
		- potentially one for talking through issues, and another for triage
	- let people chat
	- teams that joke are often better at admitting mistakes and disagreeing without taking offence

### team-only spaces

- people need to be able to speak amongst each other without being forced to talk out in the open
- without this freedom, the most shy people can become silent, resulting in the team losing critical input
- dedicated spaces for teams to chat without input from people in other teams is critical for team members not to feel like they're being watched by the entire organisation
- for a new private chat space, be the one sharing memes, wins, and well-wishes to encourage others to feel comfortable to do so

## ch 4

### your team is 'we', not 'them'

- when giving credit for work, exclude yourself, when taking responsibility for failures, exclude everyone else and take full responsibility

### the wider organisation

- your team is part of a system - it is not an entity in isolation
- as within a team, groups must collaborate in order to meet the company's goals together
- Patrick Lencioni’s book "The Advantage" describes this

### Yes, the Leadership Team as

- the leadership team is also a team, should be treated as your team, and how you speak about them is important
- when talking about leadership decisions, always refer to the decisions as though you're part of that team
	- teams need balance and clarity, and alignment with those senior to them is critical
- demonising other teams is ultimately unhealthy for the organisation
- decisions that violate your core values, however, are an exception. If this happens frequently, it may be time to find work elsewhere
- pressure from leadership should be translated motivationally, with the intent to collaborate both within and outside the team to meet the objectives

## ch5

### happiness and drive

- the culture and morale of your team is a large part of your responsibility

### flow and purpose

- being in flow changes one's perception of frustrating tasks, allowing them to push through more easily than when not in a flow state
- the following conditions need to be met in order to create an environment where flow can be achieved:
	- there is alignment on the work
	- the work is challenging, but not impossible
	- the team feels they're building something towards a common goal - that they have each others backs
	- team members feel respected
	- there is timely and fair feedback, both from humans, and in DX - i.e. compilation success, tests, PRs, etc.
	- fair pay, bonuses, and promotions for hard work
	- caring more for continuous improvement than ego
	- people believe in the team members and what they're working on
- celebrate team members when they do well, as soon as possible

### achievements and rewards
- intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation - are team members intrinsically motivated to produce good work
- intrinsic motivation is only achievable and maintainable if the person is being fairly compensated
- those motivated by intrinsic rewards have been found to be more productive, according to the book "Drive"
- part of a manager's job is ensuring team members' basic needs are met via fair compensation, requiring one to work with HR or stakeholders who have influence over payroll

#### social connection

- team members who are socially connected to each other:
	- feel that work feels less like work
	- are less affected by stress
	- are happier
- it's important to encourage bonds between team mates
- if there are signs that trust in the team is lacking, then work must be done to improve trust
	- have members do a short 5-minute presentation on something that interests them, non-work related
	- escape room, or some kind of game
	- eat the same food together - if remote, schedule food to be delivered at the same time
	- have everyone talk about something personal
		- what they wanted to be growing up
		- greatest challenges growing up
		- what superpower did they wish for
		- etc.

#### peer and mob programming

- can be useful for team building, but detrimental if done wrong
- person with the most knowledge has to remain patient
	- good candidates to lead are those who derive value from supporting others, not boosting their own self-esteem
- useful exercise for thinking through a 0-1 project, i.e. something that has no implementation
	- good for architectural choices
	- good for code review as team has a mutual understanding
- helps remote teams feel connected - people get to do hard thinking together, which builds connection

#### negative bias

- people have a tendency for a negative bias, which served us well for survival
- negative bias makes one tend to perceive a greater threat than their usually is
- positive emotions have a countering effect to negative emotions, so it can take work reframe the tendency towards the negative
- some techniques to respond to knee-jerk negative reactions:
	- check the facts - a circumstance may elicit a negative reaction, but evaluating the facts can provide a more balanced view of the circumstances
	- actively seek the positive - one generally positive team member has a measurable impact on a team's productivity
	- reject negativity - as a manager you may sometimes need to flat-out reject negative viewpoints
	- review negative consequences - are the outcomes of an action really as bad as perceived?
	- step away - if volatile people are stuck in a bad loop, let everyone step away to cool down and do a 1:1 with the volatile person
- people who generally think more positively, or deliberately think about happy times before stressful tasks outperform those with neutral or negative outlooks for the same tasks
- good culture and team morale are critical for a healthy team to work well together

## ch6

- team members are never more demoralised as when they're unsure where their careers are headed, or if their title or compensation is fair
- team members need to know their work is valued, and that they have direction

### doing everything yourself does not help
- team members need to be given the skills for them to develop their own careers, whether its teaching them to advocate for themselves, or helping them develop
