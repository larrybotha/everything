## ch 1

### caring for your team

- the work of a manager is to enable everyone around you
- this requires managers to embrace interruption-driven work, which requires a lot of collaboration and communication, in order to allow their team to enjoy flow-driven work
- engineering managers have experience they can impart on team members, but their most important tasks are:
	- making sure each team member understands why their work is important
	- helping each team member with what their career trajectory looks like
- engineering managers' scope of responsibilities extends beyond the impact of their code:
	- they impact the lives of their team members directly
- requires understanding 
	- power imbalances
	- people structures
	- strategies outside of the project
- bad managers are flippant about their responsibilities and consequences of their decisions - this job requires caring for team members in order to do it well

## ch 2

- values are the beliefs that guide and motivate us, and determine our actions
- the values people hold are a fundamental aspect of understanding how to work with groups of people
- an individual's values help one to understand what drives and motivates that person
- values dictate a person's actions and ethics
- NLP suggests considering motivations for people's actions - values determine what those actions are, and a person's history plays a large role in the values they have developed
	- i.e. they provide context to actions
- understanding values is important in helping team members understand each other, and helps build trust and vulnerability in the team
- values exercise:
	- build a list of values
	- have each team member choose 5 that resonate with them
	- have each team member chat about why they resonate with those values
	- team leader should start if the team is shy
- if there are trust issues and it feels uncomfortable to do this exercise, it's potentially more valuable for the team
- without understanding the values of others, one can be bound by their own context and limitations
- people may be misaligned in their values, e.g. Sam doesn't want people to speak badly of them, but will speak badly of others (integrity misaligned)
	- pointing the issue out is harmful, and is weaponising the person's values against them - don't do this
	- instead, focus on hearing the feelings and needs behind the message

### your own values

- understanding one's own values helps to shoe areas in our lives where we felt aligned, and contrast them with times where things didn't feel right
	- one's values can be evaluated in interactions with others - why do we find some people compelling, while others we find irritating?
	- how does one's values affect leadership style?
	- 

### company values

- companies have values, too, and need to align, at least partially, with your own
- they may be documented, or elicited more subtly via priorities, communication, and organisational structure
- e.g.
	- at Rackspace "fanatical support in all we do.’"
	- at Netlify "The best idea can come from anywhere."
- good company values convey a viewpoint that can be easily understood and checked against
- they should make it clear what the driving forces in the organisation are

### team values

- Sarah creates a list for every org she joins
- these are things that are important to the team, but not necessarily the org as a whole
- e.g.
	- We celebrate everyone’s wins as though they’re our own.
	- No compare and despair.
	- Be empowered to forge forward, we hired you because you’re an expert.
	- Make mistakes.
	- Choose impact over butts in seats (We’re not counting hours here, focus on making an impact and work when and how you want).
- these should be built by the team, and adapted as values change
- it's ok for people not to align with a team's values - other teams will have other values
- misalignment leads to burnout

### values and boundaries

- values need to be identified and protected
- misalignment leads to burnout, and it happens incrementally
- living incongruently with your values is unsustainable; the same applies if your team is expected to operate incongruently with the team's values or their own
