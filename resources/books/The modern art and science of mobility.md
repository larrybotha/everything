### ch 1.1

- pain limits the use of deep postural muscles, which are then compensated for by larger and less co-ordinated muscles, leading to atrophy

> In 2003, Moseley and his team also determined that a personâ€™s anxiety about potential pain affects the nervous system

### ch 1.2

- Trigger points are small areas of muscle that are painful to the touch
- trigger points can cause pain elsewhere, e.g. pain the glutes can transfer to back pain
- usually the shape of a pea or uncooked spaghetti
- akin to brushing one's hair and reaching a knot - blocks the body from operating normally
- aim for intensity of 5 out of 10 when massaging trigger points
	- frequency is more important than intensity
	- massage nearby if trigger point is too painful
- passive trigger points are only noticeable during massage or spasm
- active trigger points are always noticeable, even without activation
- primary trigger points
	- can be active or passive
	- can radiate to other areas
- secondary trigger points
	- the result of radiation of primary TPs
- fascia is the thin sheath of connective tissue surrounding organs

### ch 1.3

- pain is information, and should be examined, not ignored
- tissue operates like a sponge, where under pressure fluid leaves the error, and returns without pressure
- self massage:
	- optimises recovery
	- short and long-term pain relief
	- easier movement
	- improves warm-ups without affecting performance
- golden rules of self-massage:
	- move gently, and be mindful. Deeper areas need more time and care
	- unfamiliar areas need the most attention
	- alternate between moving the body, and moving the massage tool
		- For increased fascial movement, the body should move on the tool
		- For areas of tension, the tool should move on (over) the body
