## part 1

### ch 1.1

- pain limits the use of deep postural muscles, which are then compensated for by larger and less co-ordinated muscles, leading to atrophy

> In 2003, Moseley and his team also determined that a personâ€™s anxiety about potential pain affects the nervous system

### ch 1.2

- Trigger points are small areas of muscle that are painful to the touch
- trigger points can cause pain elsewhere, e.g. pain the glutes can transfer to back pain
- usually the shape of a pea or uncooked spaghetti
- akin to brushing one's hair and reaching a knot - blocks the body from operating normally
- aim for intensity of 5 out of 10 when massaging trigger points
	- frequency is more important than intensity
	- massage nearby if trigger point is too painful
- passive trigger points are only noticeable during massage or spasm
- active trigger points are always noticeable, even without activation
- primary trigger points
	- can be active or passive
	- can radiate to other areas
- secondary trigger points
	- the result of radiation of primary TPs
- fascia is the thin sheath of connective tissue surrounding organs

### ch 1.3

- pain is information, and should be examined, not ignored
- tissue operates like a sponge, where under pressure fluid leaves the error, and returns without pressure
- self massage:
	- optimises recovery
	- short and long-term pain relief
	- easier movement
	- improves warm-ups without affecting performance
- golden rules of self-massage:
	- move gently, and be mindful. Deeper areas need more time and care
	- unfamiliar areas need the most attention
	- alternate between moving the body, and moving the massage tool
		- For increased fascial movement, the body should move on the tool
		- For areas of tension, the tool should move on (over) the body
- massage everywhere, even the least likely areas. The more you massage the areas that you never touch, the more you increase your chances of finding areas that are experiencing muscle memory. Common areas:
	- The bottom of the feet (the arch of the foot, the ball of the foot, and the heel)
	- The front of the shins
	- The back of the knees
	- Under the armpits
	- The inner part of the quadriceps
	- The hip rotators
	- The top of the hips
	- The upper neck muscles, just under the head
- passive stretching reduces muscle responsiveness, whereas self-massage promotes it
- the effects of self-massage only appear for 10 minutes - do it just before engaging in the exercise it will benefit
- massaging the opposite limb has a benefit on the other
- self-massage warm-up recommendations:
	- arch of foot: 1 to 2 times, 60s per foot
	- everywhere else: 2 to 3 times, 30s per muscle
- the more one performs self-massage during warmups, the quicker the benefits during workouts will be seen
- massaging the arch of the foot has a number of outsized benefits:
	- relieves tension in the foot
	- optimises support
	- wakes up nervous system
	- improves flexibility in posterior chain, especially hamstrings amnd spine
- everyone should always have a massage ball for their feet

### ch 1.4

- pain is not inevitable
- 4 rules to restore functional mechanics of movement and posture:
	- fix your posture
	- move things that don't want to move but should
	- mobilise areas of localised pain
	- work areas above and below where you experience pain, whether painful or not
- self-massage is only one aspect of healing - moving, and regaining range and motor control are also critical

#### lumbar pain scan

- sphinx
- Woolsey test
	- lie on stomach
	- cross arms under chin
	- attempt to flex heel towards buttock
	- should be able to bend knee past 120 degrees
- ball between ribs and pelvis
	- lie on back
	- bend legs 90 degrees
	- move ball between fleshy part of lumbar and floor, looking for painful spots

#### roller massage on the back

- starting with roller massage is a good idea for massage sessions
- cross arms and hold shoulders for more effective massage
- 1 to 3 reps of 1 minute
- alternate between light and hard pressure for 5s intervals on trigger points

#### roller massage on glutes

- fold ankle over knee of other leg, and massage large butt muscle, and outer butt muscle
- 10 reps front to back, then 10 reps side to side, then switch leg, up to 3 times
- alternate between strong and weak pressure with 5s intervals on trigger points

#### lower back roller stretches

- place roller under lower lumbar, extending arms and legs out and relaxing
- alternate with bringing knees to chest with roller still supporting lower lumbar
- perform 3 sets of 20 seconds of each position without rest - i.e. 2 minutes

#### stretch the functional chain
