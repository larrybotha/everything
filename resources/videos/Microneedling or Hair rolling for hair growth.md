## Takeaways

- [[microneedling]] is apparently good for:
	- alleviating scars
	- surgeries that require grafting
	- diminishing excess sweating 
	- topical drug therapy
	- melasma
	- skin rejuvenation
	- in combination with hair treatments
- appears to work via two mechanisms for hair:
	- causes cells to release chemicals involved in repair
	- activates stems cells
- helps turn finer hairs into thicker hairs - number of hairs is not usually the side effect
- derma-rollers are effective, but can cut the hair like you're having a hair cut
	- derma-pen is more recommended as it punctures vertically
- studies have shown that there is a positive correlation with hair growth and:
	- number of times the skin is gone over
	- longer length of the needles
		- too deep can create scarring, which can then be detrimental to hair growth
- androgenic alopecia also results in thinning of the scalp
	- depth of needless needs to be adjusted accordingly
- the desired endpoint is more important than the number of times to go over the skin:
	- look for pinpoint bleeding and redness
	- typically safe to wash hair 6 hours after treatment
- frequency: varies from weekly to 8 weeks 
- avoid applying minoxidil on the same day - likely uncomfortable and burns
- to start at home:
	- start at .5mm length
	- start at every 4 weeks, work towards 1 or 2 weeks
	- give it 6 months before deciding to stop
