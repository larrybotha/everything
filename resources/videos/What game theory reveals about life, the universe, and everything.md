Takeaways:

- it can be advantageous to be:
	- nice
	- forgiving
	- provocable
	- clear

- the [[prisoner's dilemma]] was used as the basis for a game competition for research purposes
- the outcome of the tournament was that for situations where individuals are interacting more than once, for an unknown amount of times, the following qualities lead to consistently better outcomes for both individuals:
	- be nice
	- be forgiving - don't let previous defections influence the current decision
	- retaliate when your opponent defects - punish bad behaviour; don't be a pushover
	- being clear, i.e. unambiguous, or random strategies are not beneficial
