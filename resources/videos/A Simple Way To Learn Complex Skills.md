## takeaways

- learning complex skills where multiple simpler skills are required at the same time is difficult
	- e.g. in StarCraft one needs to:
		- manage and acquire resources
		- scout the map
		- attack opponents
		- defend against attacks
- research has shown that being able to dedicate time to individual skills improves rates of learning when compared to individuals who are instructed to operate in the complex environment without a focus on any specific skill
	- e.g. in surfing:
		- practicing pop-ups on land
		- practicing drive on surf skates 
		- reading waves from the beach
