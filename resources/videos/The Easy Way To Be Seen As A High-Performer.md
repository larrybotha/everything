- the gap between what you know and what other people see is how you get overlooked

> Make your work seen

Ways that your work becomes invisible

- everyone forgets

## Everyone forgets

e.g. you deliver a large project in March, performance review comes around in
December, no one remembers what you did - even you

- people are busy with their own lives - the work you did is not top of mind
- if it's not fresh in people's minds, people aren't going to remember
- the work you did at the beginning of the year is competing with what you did last month
- recency bias wins
- take any month of the year - recall what you did. Unless it was a trip or something
  signifcant, you can't remember

### Solution: managee a brag book

- aggregate everything you do into one place:
  - commits
  - meeting notes
  - emails
  - slack messages
  - everything that shows what you did for the year
- feed everything into an LLM:
  - ask it to summarise the year
  - provide it context into what is important for your review
  - for companies that describe what performance looks like, provide that as
    additional context
- you want 3 - 4 big achievements for the year

## Learn how to communicate effectively

- people who communicate more effectively are noticed more than those who don't,
  regardless of skill on the job
- mediocre skills and good communication are more effective in being recognised
  than exceptional skills and poor communication
- exceptional skills and good communication are a force to be reckoned with
- engineers often have the problem of describing things at the wrong altitude
- connect at the right altitude; adapt how things are described to the context:
- you're not done with a task until you've thought about how to communicate it
  to other people
  - peers may want technical details
  - managers want the outcome and what it means for the team
  - skip-level wants to know how it connects to organisation priorities
  - leaders want business impact in one sentence
- if I had 10 seconds to explain why this work matters, what would I say
- to practice, go to brag book, and describe the impact at different altitudes:
  - peers
  - manaegers
  - skip
  - leaders: business impact in 1 sentence

## Share your work

- many people don't want to be seen as a self-promoter
- choosing between being yourself and being a self-promoter is not that same
- as choosing between seen and being invisible
- make your work public - don't put yourself in a situation where people need to
  ask what you've done; make it available so that they can follow along with
  progress as it unfolds
- aim to communicate in such a waay that your manager never has to ask for your
  status
- one way of doing this is recognising other people's good work, and letting
  their manager know
- building other people up is healthy for team morale, while improving your
  visibility
- report on how things are moving along
