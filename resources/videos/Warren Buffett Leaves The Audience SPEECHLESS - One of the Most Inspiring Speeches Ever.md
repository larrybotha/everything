When building a business, focus on:

- delighting customers
- working through other people (multiplying yourself)
- associating with people who will move you in a better path 

## takeaways

- Berkshire Hathaway has purchased successful companies from people who have started out with little:
	- one woman started out with $2500, which took 20 years to save, some little English, and couldn't read or write
	- another started a new business, taking on massive rental car companies, at 40
- what these people had in common was:
	- the determination to work hard
	- a focus on creating an experience that delighted their customers, above everything else. This is what [[Ramit Sethi]] says about needing only 1000 loyal customers
- in addition to delighting customers, and a hard-work ethic:
	- having an interest in other people's well-being
	- working with people who in turn want to delight customers - multiply yourself through other people
	- a desire to better ones self
	- surround yourself with people that are better than you, and learn from them
	- seek out people who are examples to you, rather than people who you need to be an example to
