- interview with [[Carson Gross]]
- Carson mentions teaching students to build a [[recursive descent parser]], which IIRC was mentioned in the HTMX book
- [[Jaak Panksepp]] did a lot of research on rats, and discovered that during play, dominant rats would consistently pin other rats down 70% of the time - see [[The ontogeny of play in rats]]

![[No plan survives first contact...]]

- expect plans not to go according to plan, and thus develop multiple strategies
- be prepared for multiple outcomes
