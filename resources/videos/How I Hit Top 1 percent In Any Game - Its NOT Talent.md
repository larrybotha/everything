- choose goals by looking at the people whose skills you want to achieve
  - ignore the intermediate people - they don't matter
  - be aware of [[noob trap|noob traps]], and do not spend time on them
  * ignore how stupid you may feel while developing the skill
- balance soft learning, hard learning, and experimentation
  - soft skills are insights gained from professionals, which enhance hard
    skills, but do nothing on their own
  - hard skills are the implementation or practice of the skill
  - experimentation allows you to gain deeper insights

## Takeaways

- learning how to learn - probably the most important skill to learn
- becoming world-class at games is not due to talent - it's a learned skill
  - e.g. learning how to solve a Rubik's cube - it's a learned sequence of
    steps, and that's it
  - watching someone solves a Rubik's cube may appear haphazard, but if the
    person knows what they're doing, what appears to be chaos to unknowing
    onlookers will suddenly resolve to the solution
  - the most optimal way to a goal is not always the prettiest
- reaching a goal quickly is like learning to drive - start by looking to the
  horizon
- almost every well-designed has [[noob trap]]s
  - noob traps are designed to:
    - make the game fun for new players
    - make players feel like they're playing way above their skill level
- the most important thing for developing any skill is to avoid falling into a
  noob trap
  - noob traps will not benefit you at all later one - these skills only waste
    your time if you're attempting to become good at a skill
  - e.g. in Ana, there's a technique that will level players up rapidly, but at
    higher skill levels this technique is easy to counter. Players who level
    up using this technique:
    - think they have earned a level of play that they haven't
    - are being exposed to players who are far more skilled than they are
      because the game thinks they are at the appropriate skill level
  - the time used 'levelling up' in the noob trap is wasted - you'll have to go
    back to learning the correct fundamental skills _anyway_

### How to think about goals

- determine where you want to get by looking at the skills that the people
  who are at the level you want to be at have acquired - _what does a person
  who has X skill look like?_
- ignore what the people at intermediate levels between you and your desired
  level are at - it doesn't matter. Focus only on how the people at the
  actual level of skill you are looking for operate
  a. do not waste your time learning irrelevant skills
- understand the fundamental skills that need to be developed
- ignore how stupid you look while practicing - focus on acquiring the
  separate foundational skills that are required for the complex skill, and
  with enough practice, feedback, evaluation, and correction, the individual
  skills will snap into place

### Balancing soft learning, hard learning, and experimentation

- soft learning
  - consuming content that doesn't directly affect your own ability, e.g.
    reading books, watching videos, and generally consuming material without
    application
  - this is where insight from professionals or experienced people comes from,
    which is important
  - too much soft learning does nothing for your own abilities if there's
    nowhere to apply what you've consumed
  - soft skills are multipliers ontop of your other skills, but on their own
    they provide no value
- hard learning
  - practice or implementation of the actual skill that you're attempting to
    develop
  - hard skills are important, but learning from others, i.e. soft skills,
    drastically improves your ability to improve your execution
- self-experimentation
  - attempting things that are outside of the content you've consumed

e.g. the author describes learning League Of Legends:

- go into the game, pick a hero, and start playing the hero _without_ consuming
  any content on the hero, apart from some fundamentals, like a build order
  guide
  - the idea is to not taint your knowledge of the skill with anyone else's
    knowledge
  - as a new player you have a completely new outlook on the game - you are in a
    great position to come up with new ideas
- once they've got a little bit of experience playing the hero, they would then
  go consume content from professionals
- go back and assimilate the new knowledge into their play
