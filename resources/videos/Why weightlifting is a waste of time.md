## takeaways

- muscles handle different loads at different extensions
	- e.g. for bench presses, the pecs with arms extended can handle forces 7x more than when the arms are pulled back ready to extend
- according to this medical professional, moving static weights is inferior to moving weights that change dynamically, because the capacity the muscle can handle is not matched as the muscle extends
- training with weights that change depending on extension is called [[variable resistance training]]
	- e.g. with bench presses one could tie chains to the end of the barbell, hanging on the floor. The further the barbell moves from the floor, the higher the weight
- variable resistance training apparently shows results much faster
- elastics must be used with caution on joints such as wrists and ankles - these joints can't handle twists well, and elastics under pressure tend to turn these joints dangerously
- this sorta seems to relate to [[Scott Young]] talking about [[The 85% Rule for Learning]]
