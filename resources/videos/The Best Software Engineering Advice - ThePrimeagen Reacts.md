- Prime lives Zig
	- good for learning low-level concepts
	- almost as safe as Rust with a fraction of the difficulty to write
	- people use Zig to compile C because it's easier in Zig than it is in C
	- has no concept of macros - one can write Zig that generates Zig at compile-time
- Prime recommends the combo of tech the author is selling in his course (linked below)
	- as in [[Gleam 1.0 has been released]], Prime loves Go
- Prime intentionally learns a specific language to a desired level of proficiency, ignoring everything else until he's achieved the goal - Go is the language for the goal at time of publishing
	- Prime says he deliberately moved from Rust to Go
- focus on solving problems, not chasing the dopamine of specific technologies
