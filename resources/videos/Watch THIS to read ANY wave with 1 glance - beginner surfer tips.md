## Takeaways

- watch for waves on the horizon - darker lines mean large waves
- look for the peak - if the peak is difficult to identify, it may be that the wave is going to close out
- look for the shoulder
	- the more gradual the shoulder, the longer the ride 
	- the steeper the shoulder, the faster the wave, and potentially the shorter the ride
