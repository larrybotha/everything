- do interviews at companies you don't care about before going to ones you do
  care about:
  - you learn about the process
  - you learn that they ask similar questions
  - you get exposed to the aspects of interviews that are stressful
- +-300 leet code questions is a good thing to aim for
- learn data structures and algorithms before doing these problems
- the contest on leet code is a good way to create a similar environment to
  being timed in a whiteboard scenario
- attempt to solve these problems on a whiteboard before solving them in leet
  code - can you solve the problem, insert it into leet code, and then have it
  run first time?
- open source is a fantastic way to improve one's odds of getting better jobs -
  try to add 3 good PRs to a popular project that is meaningful to you
  - the idea is to be interesting - solving only leet code problems does not
    make you interesting
  - working in open source also makes you work with teams, exposes you to other
    people's style of writing code, and will improve you as a communicator
