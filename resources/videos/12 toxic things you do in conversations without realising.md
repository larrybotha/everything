## criticising

- most people harbour self-hatred
- don't point things out about other people that they already don't like
- instead, search for their virtues

### name calling

- labelling or name calling creates a stigma of the other person
- Carl Rogers - people are processes, not products
- by labelling someone, you're setting their identity in stone
- this applies to both positive and negative labels - "you're smart", "you're an idiot" etc.
- can put pressure on people to be consistent with the label we've given them
### diagnosing / psycho-analysing

- analysing why someone is behaving in a certain way
	- "I can read you like a book"
	- "just because you did x, you think y"
- is a symptom of avoidance of listening

### praising evaluatively

- this is to make a positive judgement of someone with the expectation that you'll get something out of the person
- praising someone in return for someone is a transaction
- instead, praise people without any expectations:
	- when you... [ action ] I feel... [ emotion ] because... [ effect ]
	- e.g. when you _greet me after work_ I feel _loved_ because _it shows me you value our time together_

## sending solutions to others

### ordering

- ordering someone is making the assumption they don't know any better
- telling someone to do something without giving an explanation, e.g. "because I said so"

### threatening

- making an order where the negative consequences are highlighted
- this is toxic, and the relationship is being held hostage

Ordering and threatening can have the following effects:

- _reactance_ - where the other party will deliberately dig their heels in or do
    the opposite of what they are ordered to
- _overly submissive_ - a relationship where one person is a tyrant

As an alternative to ordering and threating:

- respect others' autonomy
- prefer suggesting things to others, allowing them to decide for themselves.
    _Ask_ if they even want advice

### moralising

- most evident in the the use of the word 'should'
    * you _should_ do X
    * it's the right thing to do
    * you don't _x_ enough
- moralising statements diminish the self-expression of others
- this also paints the person delivering the solution as a holier-than-thou thinker
- you have no idea where people have been, where they are, or where they're going,
    so avoid taking a top-down approach to their lives

### excessive or inappropriate questioning

- asking questions that are not appropriate to what they are talking about
- instead, ask questions, or make statements that indicate you are listening:
    * it seems/sounds/looks like x was y for you

### advising

> Advice is often a basic insult to the intelligence of the other person. It implies
> a lack of confidence in the capacity of the person with the problem to understand
> or cope with his or her problem.
> As Norman Keagan puts it, "in essence, we implicitly say to someone 'you've been
> making a big deal out of a problem whose solution is immediately apparent to -
> how stupid you are'"

[_Robert Bolton_](#links-and-resources)

- giving advice is something that people do to make themselves feel better
- giving advice is ignoring the complexity of other people's lives - guilt, shame,
    issues, past, emotions, etc.
- instead, allow people to vent, acknowledge that situations are more complicated
    than we often appreciate, and that people don't always want a solution
