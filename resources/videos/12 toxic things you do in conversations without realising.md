## criticising

- most people harbour self-hatred
- don't point things out about other people that they already don't like
- instead, search for their virtues

### name calling

- labelling or name calling creates a stigma of the other person
- Carl Rogers - people are processes, not products
- by labelling someone, you're setting their identity in stone
- this applies to both positive and negative labels - "you're smart", "you're am idiot" etc.
- can put pressure on people to be consistent with the label we've given them
### diagnosing / psycho-analysing

- analysing why someone is behaving in a certain way
	- "I can read you like a book"
	- "just because you did x, you think y"
- is a symptom of avoidance of listening

### praising evaluatively

- this is to make a positive judgement of someone with the expectation that you'll get something out of the person
- praising someone in return for someone is a transaction
- instead, praise people without any expectations:
	- when you... [ action ] I feel... [ emotion ] because... [ effect ]
	- e.g. when you _greet me after work_ I feel _loved_ because _it shows me you value our time together_

## sending solutions to others

### ordering

- ordering someone is making the assumption they don't know any better
- telling someone to do something without giving an explanation, e.g. "because I said so"

### threatening

- making an order where the negative consequences are highlighted
- this is toxic, and the relationship is being held hostage

Ordering and threatening can have the following effects:

- _reactance_ - where the other party will deliberately dig their heels in or do the opposite
- _overly submissive_ - a relationship where one person is a tyrant
