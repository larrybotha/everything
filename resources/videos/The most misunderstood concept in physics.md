- entropy is the tendency for energy to spread out
- a low likelihood indicates low entropy, and vice versa
## Takeaways
- video about [[entropy]]
- first two laws of thermodynamics:
	- the energy of the universe is constant
	- the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum
		- i.e. energy spreads out over time
		- e.g. hot things cooling down, cool things heating up
- the amount of useful energy in a system is always decreasing - e.g. via energy escaping through heat, sound, etc.
- the likelihood of a Rubik's Cube being solved is highly unlikely, whereas there are quintillions of ways for it to be unsolved, a highly likely state
- aircon:
	- a decrease in temperature inside is achieved by increasing the temperature outside - the inside of the house experiences a decrease in entropy
	- there is an increase in entropy where the power is generated, and also where the resultant heat from the cooling is expelled
- states:
	- low probability is low entropy
	- high probability is high entropy
- the Sun transmits a small number of high energy photons that are then spread out on Earth, and then emitted back into space as many low energy photons
- time passes as a result of the universe increasing entropy - becoming more stable - until at some point energy is so spread out that nothing interesting will happen
	- this is called The Heat Death Of The Universe
- low and high entropy are not complex systems - it's the transition from low to high where interesting things happen
	- mixing two liquids - both are initially uninteresting, then they mix in interesting patterns, then when entropy maximises the combination is less interesting
