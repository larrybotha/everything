# Takeaways
- cortisol from the morning sun is critical to regulating our energy and sleep levels throughout the day
	- artificial light doesn't contain enough light
	- the light we get the most benefit from is before +-8am, absolute latest 10am
- avoiding bright light at night is critical to good sleep, too. Any light between 11pm and 4am is particularly bad for sleep. Our eyes become more sensitive to light as the day goes on - even small amounts of light late at night have a significant impact on our sleep
- letting light penetrate your eyelids in the morning while you're sleeping is a good way to adjust your sleep patterns to an earlier time of day
- meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis are effective ways of improving sleep, and can be done at any time of day
	- it's difficult to use the mind to calm the mind - these practices encourage using the _body_ to calm the mind, instead, which is much more effective
- candle-light is a great way to minimise the effect of bright light in the evening
- [[Non-sleep deep rest]], or as Andrew calls it, NSDR
	- is a wakeful state with similar benefits to sleep where one uses the body to:
		- get deep rest
		- calm the mind
		- boost learning
	- can be done through
		- meditation
		- Yoga Nidra
		- hypnosis
