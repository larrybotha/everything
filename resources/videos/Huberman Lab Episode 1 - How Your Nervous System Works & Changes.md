## Takeaways

### What is the Nervous System

- all pain, even things such as stomach pain, stem from the nervous system
- the nervous system is essential when understanding or changing experience
- the body's actions and thoughts can be viewed as a flow of electrical activity
  between neurons

### Deja Vu

- memories are stored as patterns of electrical signals
  - if neurons are activated with the same electrical patterns, we identify
    the experience as being familiar
  - deja vu is the activation of neurons that were previously active in a
    similar circumstance

### How War, Guns & Soap Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain

- studying victims of brain injuries in World War II led to the discovery that
  speech and comprehension, among other things, are controlled in different
  parts of the brain

### Jennifer Aniston Neurons

- our brains are maps of our experience
  - an example is the Jennifer Aniston neuron - if you recognise Jennifer
    Aniston, you have neurons that will be activated when you do
  - the brain presumably works like this for all information

### Sensations, Magnetic Sensing & Mating

- our experiences are limited to what our sensory receptors can receive, e.g.
  there are things outside of our perception that we need assistance with,
  such as snakes' ability to view heat signatures, and birds' ability to sense
  magnetic fields

### Perceptions & The Spotlight of Attention

- sensation is our ability to sense stimuli, perception is our ability to
  interpret those stimuli
  - perception is negotiable - you can choose to focus on a stimulus
  - sensation occurs regardless of whether you're paying attention or not

### Multi-Tasking Is Real

- multi-tasking is real - old-world primates are capable of 'covert attention'
  where we have two spotlights of attention that we can direct on different
  stimuli at the same time, e.g. listening to someone talk while tasting the
  food we're eating
  - these spotlights can also be made more concentrated, or more diffuse
  - they can also both be directed at the same thing

### Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Control of Behavior

- the nervous system has a [[Bottom Up vs Top Down]] dual nature:
  - reflexive system - unconscious actions, such as walking, that are
    controlled by the nervous system processing sensory information,
    i.e. bottom-up
  - reactive system - deliberate actions, such as catching a ball, that are
    directed by our thoughts and perceptions, i.e. top-down

### Focusing the Mind

- reflexive actions consume less energy than reactive actions
  - e.g. taking a stroll vs filling out a questionnaire

### Emotions + The Chemicals of Emotions

- feelings and emotions are products of the nervous system
- they are the result of [[neuromodulators|neuromodulator]] being released
  from neurons, such as [[Serotonin]] and [[Dopamine]], which determine
  which neurons will be active or inactive, resulting in an emotional
  state

### Antidepressants

- antidepressants arose in the mid-20th century as treatments that affected
  [[neuromodulators]], but often came with side-effects due to the receptors
  of those neuromodulators being on multiple organs

### Thoughts & Thought Control

- thoughts are generally reflexive, but we also have the capacity to
  deliberately control them
- thoughts are similar to perceptions, except that they draw from previous
  experience, and from anticipation of the future
