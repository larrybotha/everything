## Takeaways

### What is the Nervous System

- all pain, even things such as stomach pain, stem from the nervous system
- the nervous system is essential when understanding or changing experience
- the body's actions and thoughts can be viewed as a flow of electrical activity
  between neurons

### Deja Vu

- memories are stored as patterns of electrical signals
  - if neurons are activated with the same electrical patterns, we identify
    the experience as being familiar
  - deja vu is the activation of neurons that were previously active in a
    similar circumstance

### How War, Guns & Soap Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain

- studying victims of brain injuries in World War II led to the discovery that
  speech and comprehension, among other things, are controlled in different
  parts of the brain

### Jennifer Aniston Neurons

- our brains are maps of our experience
  - an example is the Jennifer Aniston neuron - if you recognise Jennifer
    Aniston, you have neurons that will be activated when you do
  - the brain presumably works like this for all information

### Sensations, Magnetic Sensing & Mating

- our experiences are limited to what our sensory receptors can receive, e.g.
  there are things outside of our perception that we need assistance with,
  such as snakes' ability to view heat signatures, and birds' ability to sense
  magnetic fields

### Perceptions & The Spotlight of Attention

- sensation is our ability to sense stimuli, perception is our ability to
  interpret those stimuli
  - perception is negotiable - you can choose to focus on a stimulus
  - sensation occurs regardless of whether you're paying attention or not

### Multi-Tasking Is Real

- multi-tasking is real - old-world primates are capable of 'covert attention'
  where we have two spotlights of attention that we can direct on different
  stimuli at the same time, e.g. listening to someone talk while tasting the
  food we're eating
  - these spotlights can also be made more concentrated, or more diffuse
  - they can also both be directed at the same thing

### Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Control of Behavior

- the nervous system has a [[Bottom Up vs Top Down]] dual nature:
  - reflexive system - unconscious actions, such as walking, that are
    controlled by the nervous system processing sensory information,
    i.e. bottom-up
  - reactive system - deliberate actions, such as catching a ball, that are
    directed by our thoughts and perceptions, i.e. top-down

### Focusing the Mind

- reflexive actions consume less energy than reactive actions
  - e.g. taking a stroll vs filling out a questionnaire

### Emotions + The Chemicals of Emotions

- feelings and emotions are products of the nervous system
- they are the result of [[neuromodulators|neuromodulator]] being released
  from neurons, such as [[Serotonin]] and [[Dopamine]], which determine
  which neurons will be active or inactive, resulting in an emotional
  state

### Antidepressants

- antidepressants arose in the mid-20th century as treatments that affected
  [[neuromodulators]], but often came with side-effects due to the receptors
  of those neuromodulators being on multiple organs

### Thoughts & Thought Control

- thoughts are generally reflexive, but we also have the capacity to
  deliberately control them
- thoughts are similar to perceptions, except that they draw from previous
  experience, and from anticipation of the future

Introduction
0:00
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
0:07
(upbeat guitar music) I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
0:13
at Stanford School of Medicine. For today's podcast we're going to talk about the parts list of the nervous system.
0:20
Now that might sound boring, but these are the bits and pieces that together make up everything
0:26
about your experience of life, from what you think about to what you feel, what you imagine,
0:31
and what you accomplish from the day you're born until the day you die. That parts list is really incredible
0:38
because it has a history associated with it that really provides a window into all sorts of things
0:45
like engineering, warfare, religion, and philosophy. So I'm going to share with you the parts list
0:51
that makes up who you are through the lens of some of those other aspects of life
0:57
and other aspects of the history of the discovery of the nervous system.
1:03
By the end of this podcast I promise you're going to understand a lot more about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.
1:10
There's going to be a little bit of story. There's going to be a lot of discussion about the people who made these particular discoveries.
1:16
There'll be a little bit of technical language. There's no way to avoid that. But at the end you're going to have in hand
1:22
what will be the equivalent of an entire semester of learning about the nervous system and how you work
1:30
So a few important points before we get started. I am not a medical doctor. That means I don't prescribe anything.
1:36
I'm a professor, so sometimes I'll profess things. In fact, I profess a lot of things.
1:41
We are going to talk about some basic functioning of the nervous system parts and et cetera, but we're also going to talk
1:47
about how to apply that knowledge. That said, your healthcare, your wellbeing is your responsibility.
1:53
So anytime we talk about tools please filter it through that responsibility. Talk to a healthcare professional
1:59
if you're going to explore any new tools or practices and be smart in your pursuit of these new tools.
2:06
Also wanna emphasize that this podcast and the other things I do on social media
2:11
are my personal goal of bringing zero cost to consumer information to the general public.
2:18
It is separate from my role at Stanford University. In that spirit I really want to thank
2:23
the sponsors of today's podcast. The first one is Athletic Greens which is an all-in-one drink.
2:30
It's a greens drink that has vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics. I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012
2:38
so I'm really delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I like it is because I like vitamins and minerals,
2:44
I think they're important to my health and it can be kind of overwhelming to know what to take in that landscape.
2:51
So by taking one thing that also happens to taste really good I get all the vitamins minerals, et cetera, that I need.
2:57
There's also a lot of data there now about the importance of the gut microbiome for immune health and for the gut brain access,
3:05
all these things. And the probiotics and prebiotics are important to me for that reason.
3:11
If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
3:16
and put in the code word Huberman at checkout. If you do that they'll send you a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
3:24
There's a lot in the news lately about the importance of vitamin D3. We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight
3:29
but many of us aren't getting enough sunlight. Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant
3:34
to the immune system and the hormone systems, et cetera. So once again that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,
3:41
enter Huberman at checkout, and you get the year supply of D3 and K2 along with your Athletic Greens.
3:47
This podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker which is a health monitoring company.
3:53
It uses blood tests and saliva tests to look at things like DNA and metabolic markers
3:59
and monitors your hormones, a huge number of different parameters of health
4:05
that really can only be measured accurately through blood and saliva tests. I use Inside Tracker because I'm a big believer in data.
4:12
There's a lot of aspects to our biology that can only be accurately measured by way of blood tests and saliva tests.
4:19
The thing that's really nice about Inside Tracker is that rather than just giving you a bunch of numbers back of the levels of these things in your body,
4:27
it gives you, through a really simple platform, information about what to do
4:32
with all those levels of hormones and metabolic markers, et cetera. It also has a feature which is particularly interesting
4:38
which it measures your inner age, which is more a measure of your biological age as opposed to your chronological age.
4:45
And all that information is organized so that you can make changes in your nutritional regimes or your exercise regimes
4:52
and watch how those markers change over time. So if you want to try Inside Tracker you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
What is the Nervous System
5:00
and they'll give you 25% off at checkout. So let's talk about the nervous system.
5:06
The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain is because your brain is actually just one piece
5:13
of this larger, more important thing, frankly, that we call the nervous system. The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord
5:21
but also all the connections between your brain and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.
5:27
It also includes, very importantly, all the connections between your organs
5:33
back to your spinal cord and brain. So the way to think about how you function at every level
5:39
from the moment you're born until the day you die, everything you think and remember and feel and imagine
5:45
is that your nervous system is this continuous loop of communication between the brain, spinal cord, and body
5:52
and body, spinal cord, and brain. In fact, we really can't even separate them. It's one continuous loop.
5:57
You may have heard of something called a Mobius strip. A Mobius strip is almost like one of these impossible figures that no matter which angle
6:05
you look at it from you can't tell where it starts and where it ends. And that's really how your nervous system is built.
6:11
That's the structure that allows you to, for instance, deploy immune cells,
6:17
to release cells that will go kill infection when you're in the presence of infection. Most people just think about that
6:23
as a function of the immune system but actually it's your nervous system that tells organs like your spleen
6:29
to release killer cells that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders and gobble them up.
6:37
If you have a stomach ache, for instance, sure, you feel that in your stomach, but it's really your nervous system
6:43
that's causing the stomach ache. The ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature.
6:49
So when we want to talk about experience or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way,
6:55
we really need to think about the nervous system first. It is fair to say that the nervous system governs
7:01
all other biological systems of the body, and it's also influenced by those other biological systems.
7:08
So if we're talking about the nervous system we need to get a little specific about what we mean. It's not just this big loop of wires.
7:15
In fact, there's a interesting story about that because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s,
7:22
it actually was believed that our nervous system was just one giant cell. But two guys, that names aren't super important,
7:29
but in fairness to their important discovery, Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,
7:35
figured out how to label or stain the nervous system in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,
7:41
we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells, nerve cells that are called neurons.
7:47
And that's what a neuron is. It's just a nerve cell. They also saw that those nerve cells weren't touching one another.
7:53
They're actually separated by little gaps. And those little gaps you may have heard of before, they're called synapses.
7:59
Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron are kind of spit out or vomited into.
8:05
And then the next nerve cell detects those chemicals and then passes electricity down its length
8:12
to the next nerve cell and so forth. So really the way to think about your body and your thoughts
8:18
and your mind is that you are a flow of electricity, right? There's nothing mystical about this. You're a flow of electricity
8:24
between these different nerve cells. And depending on which nerve cells are active you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm.
8:30
You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red or you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's green,
8:36
all depending on which nerve cells are electrically active at a given moment.
8:41
The example of perceiving red or perceiving green is a particularly good example because so often our experience of the world
8:49
makes it seem as if these out these things that are happening outside us are actually happening inside us.
Deja Vu
8:55
But the language of the nervous system is just electricity. It's just like a Morse code of some sort
9:02
or the syllables and words and consonants and vowels of language. It just depends on how they're assembled, what order.
9:09
And so that brings us to the issue of how the nervous system works. The way to think about how the nervous system works
9:15
is that our experiences, our memories, everything is sort of like the keys on a piano
9:21
being played in a particular order, right? If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order
9:26
and with a particular intensity, that's a given song. We can make that analogous to a given experience.
9:32
It's not really that the key, you know, A sharp or E flat is the song.
9:39
It's just one component of the song. So when you hear that, you know, for instance, there's a brain area called the hippocampus,
9:46
which there is, that's involved in memory. Well, it's involved in memory, but it's not that memories are stored there as,
9:53
you know, sentences. They're stored there as patterns of electricity in neurons that when repeated, give you the sense
10:00
that you are experiencing the thing again. In fact, deja vu, the sense that what you're experiencing is so familiar
10:08
and like something that you've experienced previously is merely that the neurons
10:13
that were active in one circumstance are now becoming active in the same circumstance again.
10:18
And so it's really just like hearing the same song maybe not played on a piano but next time on a classical guitar,
10:25
there's something similar about that song even though it's being played on two different instruments. So I think it's important
10:31
that people understand the parts of their nervous system, and that it includes so much more than just the brain
10:38
and that there are these things, neurons and synapses. But really that it's the electrical activity
10:43
of these neurons that dictates our experience. So if the early 1900s were when
10:49
these neurons were discovered, certainly a lot has happened since then. And in that time between the early 1900s and now
How War, Guns & Soap Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain
10:57
there's some important events that actually happened in history that gave us insight into how the nervous system works.
11:05
One of the more surprising ones was actually warfare. So as most everybody knows in warfare
11:13
people get shot and people often die but many people get shot and they don't die.
11:18
And in World War One, there were some changes in artillery,
11:24
in bullets that made for a situation where bullets would enter the body and brain
11:31
at very discrete locations and would go out the other side of the body or brain and also make a very small hole at that exit location.
11:39
And in doing so produced a lot of naturally occurring lesions of the nervous system. Now you say, okay, well, how does that relate
11:47
to neuroscience? Well, unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery would create these big
11:53
sort of holes as the bullets would blow out of the brain or body, I know this is rather gruesome,
11:59
when the holes were very discrete they entered at one point and left at another point, they would take out or destroy
12:06
very discrete bits of neural tissue, of the nervous system. So people were coming back from war
12:13
with holes in their brain and in other parts of their nervous system that were limited to very specific locations.
12:19
In addition to that, there was some advancement in the cleaning of wounds that happened
12:25
so many more people were surviving. What this meant was that neurologists now had a collection of patients
12:32
that would come back and they'd have holes in very specific locations of their brain. And they'd say things like, well, I can recognize faces
12:42
but I can't recognize who those faces belong to. I know it's a face, but I don't know who it belongs to.
12:47
And after that person eventually died the neurologist would figure out, ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me
12:54
that they couldn't recognize faces. And they all had these bullet holes that went through a particular region of the brain. And that's how we know a lot
13:00
about how particular brain regions like the hippocampus work. In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this,
13:08
where people would come back and they, for instance, would speak in complete gibberish whereas previously they could speak normally.
13:15
And even though they were speaking in complete gibberish they could understand language perfectly. That's how we know that speech and language
13:21
are actually controlled by separate portions of the nervous system. And there are many examples like that.
13:27
People that couldn't recognize the faces of famous people or, and that actually brings us
Jennifer Aniston Neurons
13:33
to an interesting example in modern times. Many, many years later in the early 2000s
13:39
there was actually a paper that was published in the journal "Nature", excellent journal, showing that in a human being,
13:45
a perfectly healthy human being, there was a neuron that would become
13:50
electrically active only when the person viewed the picture of Jennifer Aniston, the actress.
13:57
So literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston, so-called Jennifer Aniston cells, neuroscientists know about the Jennifer Aniston cells.
14:03
If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face you have Jennifer Aniston neurons, and presumably also have neurons
14:10
that can recognize the faces of other famous and non-famous people. So that indicates
14:16
that our brain is really a map of our experience. We come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias
14:23
towards learning particular kinds of things. It's ready to receive information and learn that information,
14:28
but the brain is really a map of experience. So let's talk about what experience really is.
Sensations
14:34
What does it mean for your brain to work? Well I think it's fair to say that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.
14:42
The first one is sensation. So this is important to understand for any and all of you
14:48
that want to change your nervous system or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better.
14:53
Sensation is a non-negotiable element of your nervous system. You have neurons in your eye that perceive
14:59
certain colors of light and certain directions of movement. You have neurons in your skin that perceive
15:05
particular kinds of touch, like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.
15:10
You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds. Your entire experience of life is filtered by these,
15:20
what we call sensory receptors if you want to know what the name is. So this always raises an interesting question.
15:26
People ask, well, is there much more out there? Is there a lot more happening in the world that I'm not experiencing
15:33
or that humans aren't experiencing? And the answer of course is yes, there are many species on this planet
15:39
that are perceiving things that we will never perceive unless we apply technology.
15:44
The best example I could think of off the top of my head would be something like infrared vision.
15:50
There are snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth, that can sense heat emissions from other animals.
15:56
They don't actually see their shape. They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions.
16:01
Humans can't do that unless of course they put on infrared goggles or something that would allow them to detect those heat emissions.
16:08
There are turtles and certain species of birds that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields
Magnetic Sensing & Mating
16:15
because they have neurons, again, it's the nervous system that allows them to do this.
16:20
So they have neurons in their nose and in their head that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields
16:27
in order to, as amazing as this sounds, go from one particular location in the ocean,
16:33
thousands of miles away to all aggregate on one particular beach
16:39
at a particular time of year so that they can mate, lay eggs, and then wander back off into the sea to die.
16:45
And then their young will eventually hatch, those cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean,
16:51
swim off and go do the exact same thing. They don't migrate that distance by vision. They don't do it by smell.
16:57
They do it by sensing magnetic fields. And many other species do these incredible things.
17:04
We don't, humans are not magnetic sensing organisms. We can't do that because we don't have receptors that sense magnetic fields.
17:11
There's some data that maybe some humans can sense magnetic fields but you should be very skeptical of anyone
17:17
that's convinced that they can do that with any degree of robustness or accuracy, because even the people that can do this
17:24
aren't necessarily aware that they can. Maybe a topic for a future podcast. So we have sensation, then we have perception.
Perceptions & The Spotlight of Attention
17:32
Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing and focus on it and make sense of it,
17:39
to explore it, to remember it. So really perceptions are just whichever sensations we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.
17:46
And you can do this right now. You can experience perception and the difference between perception and sensation
17:51
very easily. If, for instance, I tell you to pay attention to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet,
17:59
with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with, maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor,
18:04
if your feet are up maybe it's air. The moment you place your, what we call the spotlight of attention
18:10
or the spotlight of perception on your feet. You are now perceiving what was happening there,
18:15
what was being sensed there. The sensation was happening all along however. So while sensation is not negotiable
18:24
you can't change your receptors unless you adopt some new technology, perception is under the control of your attention.
Multi-Tasking Is Real
18:32
And the way to think about attention is it's like a spotlight, except it's not one spotlight.
18:38
You actually have two attentional spotlights. Anyone that tells you you can't multitask, tell them they're wrong.
18:44
And if they disagree with you tell them to contact me because in old world primates of which humans are,
18:52
we are able to do what's called covert attention. We can place a spotlight of attention on something,
18:58
for instance, something we're reading or looking at or someone that we're listening to. And we can place a second spotlight of attention
19:05
on something we're eating and how it tastes or our child running around in the room or my dog.
19:10
You can split your attention into two locations but of course you can also bring your attention,
19:15
that is, your perception, to one particular location. You can dilate your attention kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse
19:23
or you can make it more concentrated. This is very important to understand if you're going to think about tools
19:29
to improve your nervous system, whether or not that tool is in the form of a chemical
19:35
that you decide to take, maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain if that's your choice,
19:40
or a brain machine device or you're going to try and learn something better by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit
19:49
for some period of time each day. Attention is something that is absolutely
