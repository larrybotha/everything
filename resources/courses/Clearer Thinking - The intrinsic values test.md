- a value is anything that one's brain assigns value to
- extrinsic / instrumental values are only important as a means to _obtain_
    something else of value
- intrinsic values are things we value for their own sake, if we obtain
    nothing else from them
- knowing one's intrinsic values can be beneficial in different ways:
    - avoiding value traps
        - pursuing things that society deems as valuable, but do not align
        withmarkdownyour intrinsic values
    - reducing social guilt
        - identifying pressure to pursue values that we are taught as
            children that do not align with our intrinsic values
    - resolving conflicting values
        * being able to make better decisions regarding things that may
            be morally conflicting without knowing one's intrinsic values
    - minimising rationalisations
        * one can rationalise specific behaviours to match values they think
            they are supposed to have, instead of identifying the behaviour
            as a legitimate intrinsic behaviour
        * e.g. "I must have fun to prevent burnout" as opposed to
            "I enjoy having fun" without rationalising it
    - optimising plans
        * it's easier to plan for what one cares about when one knows that
            they value

To determine if something is an intrinsic value, one can ask:

> would some people value this thing for its own sake, even if they get nothing
    else from it?

- having money is not an intrinsic value
    - money allows one to _obtain_ things they value
    - without this, no one would get anything out of it
- pleasure is an intrinsic value
    - even if nothing occurs other than the pleasure someone experiences,
        it would still be valuable
- food is not intrinsically valuable
    - food is valuable because we _obtain_ nutrients and pleasure from it
    - if food doesn't provide nutrients, or doesn't taste good, it would
        do nothing
- being loyall _may_ or _may not_ be intrinsically valuable to someone
    - intrinsic valuable:
        * being loyal, even if it means not getting anything out of it
    - instrument valuable:
        * being loyal as a means to _obtain_ loyalty from others

## 5 types of intrinsic values

- Personal
    - intrinsic values associated with your own personal welfare, pleasure, and achievements.
- Well-Being
    - intrinsic values that are associated with the well-being, pleasure, and reduction of suffering for humans and animals all over the world.
- Equitable
    - intrinsic values focused on equality and human rights, including fair representation and respectful practices.
- Traditional
    - intrinsic values that place emphasis on adhering to rules (e.g., religious laws) and the preservation of human traits and traditions.
- Virtuous
    - intrinsic values related to making sure that you personally exhibit positive character traits, like honesty, kindness, or courage.

Personal results: primarily equitable

## moral circle

- intrinsic values usually fall into one of three groups:
    - those that relate to one's self
    - those that relate to one's community
    - those that relate universally

Personal results: primarily universal

## philosophy

- [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics)
    - values that tell us what kind of virtues we should aspire to have, and
        what vices we should remove from our character. As well as desirable
        character traits, these virtues include pursuits like aesthetic
        experiences and knowledge.
- [Deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology)
    - values that provide us with moral rules as to how we should act in
        certain situations. These rules determine what actions are permitted,
        forbidden, and morally required.
- [Communitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitarianism)
    - values that emphasize the individual's responsibility to the community
        (family or otherwise), along with values that regard community as a
        large part of a person's social identity and personality.
- [Utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)
    - values that focus on minimizing suffering and maximizing happiness. If
        you have this philosophy, you'll favor actions that will do the most
        good, whether or not you know the people it will impact.
- [Libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism)
    - values that seek to maximize personal autonomy and political freedom,
        emphasizing freedom of choice, and the importance of individual
        judgement. Note here that we are talking about values, not political
        views.

Personal results: primarily libertarian and Aristotelian, but not significantly
higher than the other philosophies

## world values survey

The world values survey reveals two major factors of cross-cultural variation
in the world:

- Survival values versus Self-Expression values
    * Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security.
        People with these values prioritise basic human needs, avoidance of
        harm, maintaining the resources essential for survival, and ensuring
        the longevity of those closest to them.
    * Self-expression values give high priority to things like environmental
        protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, LGBTQ rights, gender
        equality, and popular participation in economic and political
        decision-making.
- Traditional values versus Secular-Rational values
    * Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child
        ties, and deference to authority. People who embrace these values
        tend to reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia, and suicide. These
        societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic
        outlook.
    * Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the
        traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion,
        traditional family values, and authority. Divorce, abortion,
        euthanasia, and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.

Personal results:

- care more about Self-Expression intrinsic values than 54% of people who took
    the test
- care more about Secular-Rational intrinsic values than 93% of people who took
    the test
- compared to the US, my values are liket those of people in Sweden

## my most important values

1. That we do not destroy the natural environment
2. That I increase my understanding of reality beyond my current understanding
3. That animals all around the world do not suffer much during their lives
4. That the basic rights of all people are protected
5. That I have agency and can make choices for myself
6. That I continually learn new things
7. That people all around the world believe true rather than false things
