My notes: https://github.com/larrybotha/learning-rust-with-entirely-too-many-linked-lists

- teaches Rust by building list data structures
- delves extensively into smart pointers, and the pros and cons
- demonstrates many aspects that are not obvious in Rust, e.g.
	- how [[std..option..Option..take]] is a specific implementation of [[std..mem..replace]] for `Option`
	- how [[std..option..Option..and_then]] is a synonym for flatmap
