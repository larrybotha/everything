Learning occurs optimally when we are getting 85% of the answers correct

Aim to be getting 4 out of 5 attempts in learning sessions correct - you should be failing 1 out of every 5

## Takeaways

> In many situations we find that there is a sweet spot in which training is neither too easy nor too hard, and where learning progresses most quickly. […] For all of these stochastic gradient-descent based learning algorithms, we find that the optimal error rate for training is around 15.87% or, conversely, that the optimal training accuracy is about 85%.

> In a study of fourth-grade mathematics, it was found that 82 percent of students’ answers were correct in the classrooms of the most successful teachers, but the least successful teachers had a success rate of only 73 percent. A high success rate during guided practice also leads to a higher success rate when students are working on problems on their own.

- If you’re getting more than one out of every five problems wrong, you might want to add extra help
- The 85% rule suggests growth will be maximized when we practice tasks we can succeed at roughly four-fifths of the time

> [[Anders Ericsson]]'s model of [[deliberate practice]] argues that when skills become automatic, we plateau at levels of ability far below our potential. To counter this, we need to return to the deliberate phase of learning. We can do this by picking harder tasks or setting higher goals for performance.

> [[Learned industriousness]] suggests that success on hard problems can be good for us, but failure is demotivating. Once again, a difficulty sweet spot emerges where we work on problems we’re likely to succeed at, but are hard enough to encourage effort in the future.
