- variable resistance
	- muscles can exert more force in different position computer
- core principles
	- complete fatigue
		- create hypoxic environment
		- usually requires only a single set
	- constant tension
		- don't lock out at top, or relax at bottom of reps
		- slow and controlled motion
	- stabilisation
		- loading weight under instability promotes HGH production
		- resistance bands promote the use of muscles to stabilise one's body
- the energy expenditure from constant tension and complete fatigue is high - good for fat loss
## takeaways

- muscles exert different forces at different extensions
- elastics complement this variable force, engaging muscles more where they are stronger, less where they are weaker
- resistance bands allow for high reps, and high weight, which is not possible with static weights because you are limited by where your muscles are most weak
- VRT triggers [[hypertrophy]] more effectively than static weights - muscle damage is not required for hypertrophy 
- 3 principles of VRT
	- variable resistance
	- constant tension
	- stabilisation
- constant tension promotes [[hypoxia]], which increases growth hormone levels, and hypertrophy
	- don't lock out at the top
	- don't relax at the bottom
	- use slow and controlled motion
- instability promotes the use of more muscle groups
	- instability, such as using a single leg vs 2, increases HGH production
	- the greater the load and the more you challenge your stability during an exercise, the more significant the hormonal response
	- resistance band training encourages recruitment of ancillary muscles by default
- +-40 reps per exercise is sufficient - no less than 12 reps 
	- 3 phases of extension
		- full extension
		- 2/3rds extension
		- 1/3rd extension
	- push to fatigue
	- 6 - 8 reps at 2/3rds extension
	- 2 - 3 reps at 1/3rd extension
- constant tension and complete fatigue promote fat loss
- diet
	- low in sugar
	- intermittent fasting
