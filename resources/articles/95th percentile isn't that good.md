- *for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.*
- *people who are 95%-ile constantly make mistakes that seem like they should be easy to observe and correct*

Some reasons people continue to make mistakes:

1. People don't want to win or don't care about winning
2. People understand their mistakes but haven't put in enough time to fix them
3. People are untalented
4. People don't understand how to spot their mistakes and fix them

- *my belief is that it's easier to become relatively good at real life activities relative to games or sports because there's so little delibrate practice put into most real life activities*
- *Gary Bernhardt has it right when he says that, if you're giving a 30-minute talk to a 300 person audience, that's 150 person-hours watching your talk, so it's not obviously unreasonable to spend 15 hours practicing (and 30 practice runs will probably be less than 15 hours since you can cut a number of the runs short and/or repeatedly practice problem sections)*
- * important to actually track what you're doing and not just guess at what you're doing. When I've recorded what people do and compare it to what they think they're doing, these are often quite different*
