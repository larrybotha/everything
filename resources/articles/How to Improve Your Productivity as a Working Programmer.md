## Scheduling My Day Around When I’m Most Productive

- the author schedules meetings back-to-back
- the author is least productive in the afternoon, and so schedules their appointments then

## Watching Myself Code

- *Throughout the week, I have a program running in the background that records my screen. At the end of the week, I’ll watch a few segments from the previous week. While watching them, I’ll pay attention to specifically where the time went and figure out what I could have done better. When I first did this, I was really surprised at where all of my time was going*

## Tracking My Progress and Implementing Changes

- *At the end of every day, I spend 15 minutes thinking about my day. I think about what went right, as well as what went wrong and how I could have done better. At the end of the 15 minutes, I’ll write up my thoughts. Every Saturday, I’ll reread what I wrote for the week and implement changes based on any patterns I noticed*
