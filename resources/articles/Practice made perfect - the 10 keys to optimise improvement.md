- evaluate worked examples as a novice, and only then work on problem solving
- practice retrieving information
- spread learning out over time, mixing practice of older material with learning of newer material
- mix different types of practice in your sessions
- contrast similar concepts to determine what distinguishes them
- use video to analyse past performance
- get 1 out of 5 practice attempts wrong
- get feedback, both by setting goals, and by having others evaluate your performance
- practice at the level you intend performing at
## Takeaways

- practice and problem solving are distinct:
	- practice is using a known method procedure
	- problem solving is when you don't know what the correct method is 
		- problem solving can be problematic as you may not find the best method on your own
		- even if you do find the best solution, you may miss it because you're focused on the goal
	- initially, go through examples so that you can find the best method without problem-solving your way towards it
- retrieval is more effective than rereading
	- use free recall to write down everything you learnt at the end of a session, and compare with what you actually did in the lesson
	- flash cards are good for subjects with many parts
	- practice questions and mock exams are useful, but only when you are recalling methods that are already in memory
- cramming is ineffective
	- 5 study sessions of 1 hour over 10 days is more effective than 5 hours in one day
	- flash cards and spaced repetition are useful here
	- mixing practice of previously learned skills with new material is effective
- avoid predictable learning patterns
	- the world is not predictable
	- tennis is not played with only forehands, and then only backhands 
	- by mixing up practising of different skills, we overcome the brain attempting to pigeonhole learning into distinct patterns, and better emulate how life throws problems at us
- closely compare things that are similar into you understand what distinguishes them 
- use self-explanation to talk through problems and develop real understanding, as opposed to only memorising
- analyse past performance
	- make videos of yourself so that you can analyse your performance as an outsider
	- also allows for one to move analysis of the task to steer the performance
- use [[The 85% Rule for Learning]] 
	- you should be getting 1 in 5 things wrong
		- more than that, you'll be frustrated
		- fewer than that, you're not learning anything
- get feedback
	- sources of feedback can be direct or indirect
		- direct - related to the result you are trying to achieve. Either you got the result, or you didn't
			- generally more accurate
			- does not guide on how to improve
		- indirect - feedback from others, generally about performance rather than outcome 
			- good for learning what was good or bad, and how to improve
	- expert feedback will have the biggest payoffs
- practice at the level you intend on performing at
	- e.g. learning a language to watch foreign films is different to learning a language to be conversational
