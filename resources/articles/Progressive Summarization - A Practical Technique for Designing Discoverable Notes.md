Author: [[Tiago Forte]]

- summarise content at increasing levels of granularity, maintaining the original extracts or notes at all times using bolding and highlighting to draw attention to the most critical ideas
- summarise the core principles in your own words
- create something from what you've learnt

## Takeaways

- much of the content we read is useful, but not particularly at the time we're reading it - we'd likely apply the knowledge in future, but forget we even have it available to us by that point
- a solution is to forward bits of knowledge through time
- categorise content based on how much attention you need to pay attention to it:
  - short-term
  - less frequently reviewed
  - ad-hoc
  - archived - there of you need it
- the idea of [[spaced repetition]] is hinted at

### Note organisation

- two approaches:
  - tag first
  - notebook first
- tag first
  - flat hierarchy
  - pros:
    - multiple tags assigned to each note
  - cons:
    - tags can become unwieldy
- notebook first
  - tree / folder structure
  - pros:
    - hierarchy can add clarity
  - cons:
    - determining the location for a note can be difficult
- note first
  - atomic ideas that can composed into more complex notes

### Designing discoverable notes

- notes need to balance discoverability and understanding
  - these two concepts are in tension:
    - discoverability encourages the compression of notes to highly condensed summaries
    - understanding encourages adding a lot of detail and context
- the author suggest different stages to summarisation, spread out over time:
  1.  Layer 0: consuming the original full resource
  2.  Layer 1: noting the items that seem important now and maybe to future you
      - e.g. typing thoughts into Obsidian, pasting excerpts into Obsidian, highlighting and syncing, like in Readwise etc.
  3.  Layer 2: bolding important bits from Layer 1 that describe the core essence of the topic
  4.  Layer 3: highlighting the most important aspects within the bolded text
  5.  Layer 4: add an executive summary at the top of the document in their own words
  6.  Layer 5: if the content makes sense to do so with, create something new - blog post, video, sketching, tweeting etc.
