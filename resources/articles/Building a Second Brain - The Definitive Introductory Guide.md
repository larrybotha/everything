## Takeaways

#### Organise
- folders can be a hindrance to organising notes 
- use the PARA system for organising content:
	- **P**rojects - short term projects
	- **A**reas - long-term responsibilities you want to manage
	- **R**esources - articles, videos, courses, etc.
	- **A**rchive - inactive items from the other categories

> The system you use to manage information must be so effortless that it liberates your focus rather than constraining it. Your system must provide you with time, not consume it.

#### Distill
- distill your notes into actionable, bite-sized summaries
- design notes with your future self in mind
- use [[Progressive Summarization - A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes]] to summarise at different levels of detail
- you often have no idea which sources will end up being valuable until much later - *add value to a note every time you touch it*

#### Express your thoughts in the real world 
- put the information you consume to use - generate outputs from your input, create new things 
- there is no such thing as a finished product - share your work with others
