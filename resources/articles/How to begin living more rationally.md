## takeaways

- scout mindset
	- accuracy over ego - notice when you experience defensiveness when disagreed with, constructively criticised, or corrected, and instead pursue truth
	- be willing to update beliefs in light of new evidence
	- acknowledging when one may be wrong
	- contrasts with "soldier mindset", which is focused on defending one's beliefs from perceived threats and on winning arguments
- nuanced thinking
	- rejecting false dichotomies
	- various types of dichotomies:
		- truth binary - things are either true or false
		- goodness binary - things are either good or bad
		- identification binary - the rigid placement of things into categories
	- notice false dichotomies, and attempt to determine where nuanced alternatives may have been overlooked
- falsification
	- seeking to disprove one's beliefs, instead of reinforce them
	- [[confirmation bias]] deters us from seeking disconfirming evidence, but disconfirming evidence is a key way to counteract it
	- consider the 2,4,6 number pattern game - people who seek disconfirming evidence find the real answer faster
- [[charitable thinking]]
	- look for the strongest aspects of other people's views, and engage with those
	- a few forms of charitable thinking
		- assuming good intentions
		- steel manning their argument
		- Hanlon's razor
