## takeaways

- human skepticism appears to be quite domain-specific and relegated to the classroom. Somehow the skepticism of my fool undergoes a severe atrophy outside of these intellectual debates
	- he does not realize that the manager of his mutual fund does not fare better than chance
	- markets are far more random and far riskier that he is being made to believe by the high priests of the brokerage industry
	- He listens to the projections by security analysts and "experts"— not checking their past accuracy and track record. Had he checked them he would have discovered that these are no better than random — often worse
	- He believes in the government's ability to "forecast" economic variables, oil prices, GNP growth, or inflation
		- no religious figure was consulted for long-term business and economic projections
	- He believes in the "skills" of the chairmen of large corporations and pays them huge bonuses for their "performance". He forgets that theirs are the least observable contributions. This skills attribution is flimsy at best — there is no account of the possible role of luck in his success
	- He believes in the news media providing an accurate representation of the risks in the world. They don't. By what I call the narrative fallacy, the media distorts our mental map of the world by feeding us what can be made into a story that can be squeezed into our minds. For instance (preventable) cancer, not terrorism remains the greatest danger. The number of persons killed by hurricanes, while consequential, is dwarfed by that of the thousands of isolated daily victims dying in hospital beds. These are not story-worthy, implying; the absence of attention on the part of the press maps into disproportionately reduced resources allocated to their welfare
- disbelieving requires an extraordinary expenditure of energy. It is a limited resource
- the dangers of organized religion used to be there — but they have been gradually replaced with considerably ruthless and unintrospective social-science ideology
- If I were going to be gullible about a subject, I would rather pick one that is the least harmful to my future — and one that is rewarding to my thirst for aesthetics
