- mentions a study that revealed people's confirmation bias
	- participants presented with a pattern: 2-4-6
	- 4 out of participants determine incorrectly that the pattern is increasing even numbers, due to asking for validation of only the same pattern
	- 1 in 5 determine correctly that the pattern is _any_ increasing number sequence, which is only possible by seeking disconfirming evidence - i.e. they could eliminate cases by testing what potentially didn't fit, not what they thought _would_ fit
- it's more useful to look for evidence that we're wrong, instead of looking for evidence that we're right
