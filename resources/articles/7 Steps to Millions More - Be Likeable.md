## takeaways

Penelope Trunk, the author of Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success, says:

> People would actually rather work with someone who is incompetent and likeable than competent and unlikable. Most people nod in agreement when they read this. It’s the unlikable people who form arguments in their head.

> But there’s more. At work, if you are unlikable, people start thinking you are less competent. So stop thinking you can skate by on your genius IQ because you can’t. You need emotional intelligence as well. This situation is so pronounced that there are special-education classrooms rife with kids who could read when they were three. Social skills matter as much as intelligence when it comes to long-term success, even for the geniuses.

- if you’re not likeable, people will think you’re less competent. But if you are likeable, people will think you’re more competent. Both of these are independent from the fact of whether or not you actually are competent
- People don’t invest in those they don’t like. They may continue to employ them because they produce results, but if someone is going to invest the time and effort into growing and mentoring you, they have to like you
