- working for 5 to 6 years at a large company can yield the average American's full life income
- this could be done faster at a startup, but it's usually only true for early early employees, but with the risk that the company never makes it, which is much less than at a big company
## Earnings

- *you'll realize if you end up at a place like Google is that most of them are just normal programmers like you and me*
- *Big companies will hire more than 100 people per week, which means they can only be so selective*
- *Despite the hype about how hard it is to get a job at Google/FB/wherever, your odds aren't that bad, and [they're certainly better than your odds striking it rich at a startu](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/big-ipo-tiny-payout-for-many-startup-workers?trk=pulse-det-art_view_ext)*
- *The result is that people are incentivized to stay at most startups, even if they don't like the work anymore* ... *It's startups where people are incentivized to stick around even if they don't care about the job*
- *At a big company, we have a career's worth of income in six years with high probability once you get your foot in the door. This isn't quite as good as the claim that you'll be able to do that in three or four years at a startup, but the risk at a big company is very low once you land the job. In startup land, we have a lottery ticket that appears to have something like a 0.5% chance of paying off for very early employees*

- *_This post was originally written in 2015, when the $250k number would be conservative but not unreasonable for someone who's "senior" at Google or FB. If we look at the situation today in 2017, people [one entire band below that are regularly bringing in $250k](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/942452212445405185) and a better estimate might be $300k or $350k_*
