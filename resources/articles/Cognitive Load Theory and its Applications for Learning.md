- Cognitive Load Theory is the dominant paradigm for designing learning materials
- worked examples are good for novices, while problem-solving is better once cognitive load from new concepts diminishes
- steps:
  - start with worked examples
  - slow down when confused
  - understand the underlying components for subjects where there are a lot of components that interact

## Takeaways

- some things are learnt innately, such as language for children, and cultural norms, while others require guidance from others, such as maths and literacy
- [[John Sweller]] developed the theory
- a lack of fundamentals committed to long-term memory can make learning new skills difficult to learn
- cognitive load theory claims there are 3 demands that occupy our working memory:
  - intrinsic load
    - the attention required to learn a pattern that will be committed to long-term memory
  - extraneous load
    - distractions which consume working memory:
      - TV or music in the background
      - poorly designed study materials
      - flipping between pages to understand material
      - being tasked with figuring out a pattern that could be taught explicitly
  - germane load
    - effortful practice that improves the ability to recall ideas later, but are is strictly necessary in order to learn a pattern
    - e.g.
      - using [[The Feynman Technique]]
      - self explanation
      - retrieval practice
- working memory has a fixed capacity - if intrinsic load doesn't occupy all of our working memory, we have capacity to benefit from germane load. The opposite is also true - if cognitive load is overwhelming, then more challenging forms of reinforcement are not effective
- practice and problem solving are not equivalent
  - problem solving isn't a skill. It is composed of:
    - having the knowledge required to solve a specific problem
    - having automated procedures to combine underlying concepts to solve the problem
  - practice improves fluency, but having the correct method is more efficient
    - trial and error is inefficient
    - worked examples, clear instructions, and fundamental knowledge allows for more effective practice

### Key Experiments

- worked examples are more effective than problem solving when cognitive load is high
  - e.g. walking through a problem step-by-step is more effective for novices than asking them to solve the problem for themselves
  - germane load is beneficial only once the cognitive load diminishes
- Goal-Free effect
  - solving a problem implicitly requires that you store a goal in memory, while attempting to devise a procedure to get there - this introduces a lot of cognitive load
  - removing the goal from a problem is one way of reducing cognitive load
    - e.g.
      - in trig, "solve for `x`" - goal-oriented, vs "find as many angles as you can"
      - The [[XY problem]] vs brainstorming without filtering
  - goal-free problem solving is not always useful, e.g. learning to program by typing in random commands
- split-attention increases cognitive load

  - co-locate related information, instead of introducing an intermediate step of determining how things are related

    - e.g.

      ```
      # requires work
      X, Y => x', y'

        vs

      # has clarity
      X => x'
      Y => y'
      ```

- the expertise-reversal effect is where learners who have internalised patterns no longer benefit from worked examples, and benefit more from direct problem solving
  - the cognitive load from worked examples presents little to no challenge, which results in capacity for working memory to be dedicated to germane load

### Applications to learning

- Cognitive load theory favors direct instruction, quick feedback and plenty of practice.
- steps:
  - study examples before solving problems
    - Khan Academy
    - find problem sets with solutions
    - self-explain when given feedback
  - slow down when confused
    - confusion is usually an indication that critical assumptions are incorrect, or steps were skipped in the material because they were implied
    - self-explanation, such as with [[The Feynman Technique]] helps
    - missing fundamental knowledge early affects the ability to acquire subsequent knowledge later
  - build procedural and fundamental knowledge
    - difficult subjects require that one understands the fundamentals - [[When you understand mechanism...]]
    - CLT is most useful in subjects where there are many components that need to work together in order for a problem to be understood
