## takeaways

- [[trade-off matrix]] useful for evaluating [[non-functional requirements]] in system design
- to build the matrix
	- map the same attributes as rows and columns
	- reading left to right determine if there is a relationship between each pair, using an arrow to indicate if the if there is a direct correlation or inverse
		- e.g. security and simplicity are inversely related
		- simplicity and accuracy of data are likey positively correlated
- when trade-offs are discovered, many take a 'this or that' approach, but it's more fruitful to determine how to achieve both attributes while _minimising_ the trade-off, or ideally eliminating the trade-off
	- i.e. try maximise for both attributes, as opposed to accepting the trade-off as the only option
