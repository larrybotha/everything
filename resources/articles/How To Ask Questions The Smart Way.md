## Takeaways

- In general, asking yes-or-no questions is a good thing to avoid unless you want aÂ [yes-or-no answer](http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/questions-with-yes-or-no-answers.html)
- make the effort to document what you did in attempting to solve the problem before asking
- describe the problem and environment, ideally providing a minimal reproduction
	- when seeing a doctor, you describe your symptoms
- avoid presenting your assumptions about the problem - describe your expectations instead
- people in OSS are working in public - being direct, even if it may seem rude, is a way to manage their time in an environment where the volume of public can be overwhelming
- don't grovel about being inexperienced

>Q: How can I use X to do Y?
	A: If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. It is generally best to ignore such people until they define their problem better.

- There is no need of public humiliation for someone who may have made an honest mistake. A real newbie may not know how to search archives or where the FAQ is stored or posted
