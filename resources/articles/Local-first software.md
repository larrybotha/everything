## takeaways

- local-first is made possible via [[CRDT]]s
- data is stored primarily on the user's device, with the server primarily playing a role in syncing across devices
- local-first is network agnostic. Some apps may not require a network at all, while others can choose to sync over whichever medium they prefer - http, bluetooth, wifi, etc
- centralised databases can be avoided, with the local database being synced as an encrypted file on the server that cannot be read by attackers
- data ownership allows users to manipulate their local data as they choose, as opposed to being restricted by the API's of the service they are using
