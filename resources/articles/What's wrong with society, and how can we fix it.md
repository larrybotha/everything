Interview with Tim Urban from "Wait But Why"

## Takeaways

- liberalism wants to discuss, argue, and persuade people to change their minds
- illiberalism has a few degrees of intensity that are anti-liberal, where coercion is favoured over persuasion:
	- speech control - punishing people for having different ideas
		- e.g. getting people fired for their opinions, getting speakers cancelled at events, etc
		- if you think your idea is strong, then counter the other person by having your own talk
		- depriving other people of the experience is bullshit
	- indoctrination - teaching an ideology as though it's correct, as opposed to one of many possible ideologies
		- people who disagree with the ideology are seen as bad - a false dichotomy
		- instead, identify and learn about opposing points of view that support the same outcome
	- silence is violence - if you're not with us you're against us
		- compelled speech - coercing people to speak up, instead of creating a safe space where people are free to speak up or keep to themselves as they choose
		- coercing employees to post their opinions about topics on social media; requiring everyone in a group to contribute to a discussion about some form of guilt, or face the wrath of not volunteering information and vulnerability
- illiberalism exists on the left and right - coercion, speech control, indoctrination, and compelled speech must get push-back
