Summary of the book "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" which teaches the underlying principles of cooking

![[If you understand the mechanism...]]

## Takeaways

### SALT

#### General

Use non-iodised salt. (22)
Taste saltiness after it has dissolved. (24)
Salt reduces bitterness. (26)

#### Salting Meat

Salting meat and giving it time to diffuse prevents toughness when cooked. (31)
Salt takes longer to diffuse if meat is cold. (31)
Salting for too long will cure (dehydrate) meat. (32)
Don’t salt seafood more than 15 minutes ahead of cooking. (32)
For stews, salt the meat ahead of time instead of the sauce during cooking. (37)

#### Salting Other Food

Salt takes a long time to dissolve in fat. Pre-dissolving in water or acid speeds it up. (32)
Add salt to eggs before cooking. (33)
Salt watery veg ahead of roasting to draw out moisture and pat dry. (33)
Don’t salt mushrooms before cooking. (33)
Salt generally softens veg. (33)
Salt beans when soaking and when cooking. (33)
Salt toughens gluten. (34)

#### Salting Cooking Water

Never salt water that will be absorbed (e.g. when cooking rice). (34)
Always salt pasta water. (34)
If you don’t salt cooking water, it will leech out natural minerals from veg, removing both color and nutrition. (35)
Liberally salt cooking water that you plan to drain off, until it tastes as salty as the ocean, as most of the salt will be discarded. (36)
Fully dissolve salt in boiling water before adding food. (36)
Boil potatoes in salted water before roasting. (36)

#### Salting Times (40)

1 day: chicken, steak
15 mins: aubergine, courgette
Just before cooking: seafood, eggs
While cooking: mushrooms, veg
At serving: salad

### FAT

#### General

Fat has 3 roles: a binding ingredient, a cooking medium for texture, and a seasoning to add flavor. (61)
Fat carries flavor, making it more intense and linger longer. (64)
Fat enables cooking at higher temperatures than cooking in water, resulting in browning, which add flavor. (64)
Fat type determines flavor; cooking method determines texture. (74)
Fat can create 5 textures: crisp, creamy, flakey, tender, light. (74)
Pre-heat the pan before adding oil to minimise deterioration. (76)
Test temperature with a drop of water: if it crackles, it’s time for fat. (76)

#### Baking

Add vanilla extract directly to fat (e.g. butter, egg yolks). (64)
For lightness, whip the fat. (95)

#### Olive Oil

A lot of olive oil you encounter is actually rancid (smells of wax). It goes off 12 months from pressing date. (66)
If cost is a concern, it’s better to get good olive oil and dilute in a neutral oil (canola, grapeseed) than to settle for cheap olive oil. (67)
Store olive oil away from light. (67)

#### Butter

Use unsalted butter and salt to taste when cooking. (67)
Gently heat to make brown butter. (67)
Clarified butter is put fat and will not burn. (68)
Ghee is browned clarified butter. (68)

#### Animal Fat

Animal aromatic molecules are stored in fat. (69)
Lard is pork fat. It has a high smoke point. (70)
Cook bacon slowly to render (liquify) fat before the meat burns. Put in the oven at 175°C. (77)

#### Crispiness

Crispiness comes from boiling off the water in food. (75)
Cook meat with a fat cap on that side first to render and crisp it. (77)
Use high heat to crisp the outside, then lower heat and cook through. (79)
Crowding the pan or piling up food while still hot traps moisture and causes sogginess. (79)

#### Emulsions

“An an emulsion is a peace treaty between oil and water.”

Whisk oil and vinegar to create a creamy textured dressing. Use immediately, before the emulsion breaks. (80)
Emulsifiers keep fat and water from breaking apart, e.g. mustard in a vinaigrette. (80)

### ACID

Anything sour is acid. (105)
Acid causes salivation. (106)
Don’t use bottled or old lemon or lime juice, as it adds bitterness. (109)
Cellulose cooks slower in acid, which is why you cook onions first before adding tomato. (112)
Cooking beans alkaline makes them tender. Reduce acidity by adding bicarbonate of soda. (112)
Acid encourages pectin; add it to jams and fillings. (112)
Baking powder = bicarbonate of soda + tartaric acid. Acid + base = chemical leavening. (112)
Acid makes egg whites coagulate, letting them cook before losing all their water. Add a few drops of lemon juice for creamy scrambled eggs, and put vinegar in egg poaching water. (113)
Add acid to whipped egg whites to help them foam. (113)
Acid in dough or batter tenderises it—if you’re aiming for chewy, wait until the last minute to add acid. (113)
Acid denatures meat proteins, leading to moist tenderness, but if left too long they coagulate and toughen. (114)
Acid breaks down collagen in tough meat—add wine to stews at the start of cooking. (114)
Browning and fermenting raises acidity. (115)
Too sour means too much acid—aim for bright and clean instead. (117)
Macerate means to soften by soaking in acid. (118)
Deglaze with acid (e.g. wine) to prevent too much sweetness. (118)
Heat dulls vinegar and lemon flavors, so add at the end if you want to bring them out. (118)
Always balance sweetness with acid. (126)

### HEAT

#### General

Look at the food, not the heat source (e.g. watch for browning, not oven temperature). (133)
Time heat so the surface and interior are done at the same time. (134)
Carryover = residual heat that keeps cooking after you remove heat source. (151)
Key heat decision: slow and gentle (creating tenderness) or quick and intense (preserving tenderness). (154)
Oven temperatures are imprecise — use your senses. (155)
When using a convection (fan) oven, reduce temperatures by 15°C and lower cooking time. (182)
Start the oven hot for browning (>200°C) then reduce to cook through (<190°C). (185)

#### Heat + Water

If there’s steam the temperature is capped at 100°C—not hot enough for browning. (138)
Piling up food traps steam. (138)
Pans with sloped/curved or shorter sides allow steam to escape more than straight, taller sides. Use deep pots for simmering and shallow ones for searing. (139)
Salt draws out water. If you want browning, salt ahead of time and pat dry before cooking. (139)

#### Heat + Fat

Cold fat is solid. Extended gentle heat turns animal fat to liquid (renders it), which bastes meat from within. (140)
Fats are slow to change temperature and it takes a lot of energy. This means fatty food removed from heat continues cooking. (140)

#### Heat + Veg

Cellulose is not broken down by heat. It must absorb water to become tender. (141)
Leaves have less cellulose than stems. Stagger kale and similar veg into the pot, cooking stems first. (141)
Seeds, grains, and legumes have shells, which must be removed or broken down in order to digest them. Absorbing water softens them. Whole grains retain their sheaths, while processed ones have had it removed. (141)
To brown thin foods like courgette slices before the insides become overcooked, pre-heat the baking sheet or cast iron pan. (183)
Roast veg at 200°C. Salt beforehand to draw out excess water and pat dry. Don’t crowd the pan to prevent sogginess from trapped steam. Turn food and rotate trays for even browning. (184)
Tightly pack roasting veg to cook slowly and prevent burning; spread out for quick cooking and more browning. (139)
Don’t mix very different veg and expect them to cook the same. Place on seperate trays and remove each when done. (185)

#### Heat + Sugar

Sugar breaks down and caramelises at 170°C, re-forming into hundreds of tasty compounds. (143)
When cooking a carrot, starches break down into sugars and cell walls disintegrate, allowing the sugars to reach our tongues. Hence cooked carrots are sweeter than raw. (143)
Sugars in veg start to break down as soon as they are picked, so fresher means sweeter. Just a few hours at room temperature halves the sweetness of starchy veg like peas and corn. (143)
New potatoes have more sugar, which will burn when frying before they’re cooked through. Use older, starchier potatoes for chips, and rinse excess starch off after cutting for a crispier result. (143)
Pectin is present in the seeds and peels of citrus, stone fruit, and apples. To extract, cook the fruit in a cheesecloth bag then squeeze out the pectin. Pectin + sugar + acid + heat = gel. (146)

#### Heat + Protein

Proteins exposed to heat first denature (unwind) then coagulate (clump back together more tightly), entrapping water and creating structure in food. (147)
Not enough heat makes proteins go flabby. Too much heat causes clumps to tighten and squeeze out water, so food becomes dry and stringy. Just enough heat gives a firm and moist result. (147)
Eggs cooked too hot loose their water to a sad puddle on the plate—use low heat. (147)
Proteins in milk coagulate above 82°C, so do not bring to a boil. Cream doesn’t contain much protein, and flour prevents coagulation. (157)

#### Heat + Meat

Salt helps keep proteins from drying out, hence the pre-salt meat before cooking. (148)
Cook tender meat to 60°C and poultry to 70°C (internal temp). (148)
For tender meat, go hot and fast; for tough meat go low and slow. (148)
Low heat turns collagen to gelatin over time, helped by acid. (148)
Bring all meats to room temperature before cooking, so the outside doesn’t get overcooked by the time the inside is done. (151)
Get into the habit of removing meat from the fridge and salting it early. (151)
Resting after cooking relaxes proteins, allowing meat to retain more moisture. (179)
Carve against the grain for more tenderness. (179)
Fatty meats baste themselves while roasting, while lean meats need help not to dry out. (185)

#### Simmering & Poaching

Remove pasta from boiling water a couple minutes early and finish cooking in simmering sauce, to both flavor the noodles and thicken the sauce. (160)
Simmering water looks like bubbles in champagne. Poaching water looks like a glass of champagne left out over night. (161)
Poach fish in a mix of water, wine, and olive oil. (161)
For tender meat, simmer instead of boiling. (159)

#### Braising

Braising = big piece of meat + a little liquid + gentle heat + time. Stewing = small pieces of meat immersed in liquid. Both turn sinew and cartilage to gelatin. (163)
To enhance flavor, leave meat in large pieces and attached to bone (and salt well in advance). (164)
Brown meat fully on all sides. Don’t move or pick up often. Rotate pan to get an even sear. Do not allow it to fry (remove fat if it renders). Don’t rush. (164)
Deglaze browning pan with acid (wine or beer) to create braising liquid (remove fat first). (164)
Put veg on bottom, meat on top, add liquid and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. (165)
Lower temperatures take longer but dry meat out less. (165)
When braising is done, strain liquid and reduce for sauce. (165)
The flavour of braised meat improves and develops over a couple days after cooking. (165)

#### Boiling & Steaming

Use plenty of water when boiling: food needs to move freely to cook evenly, and overcrowding lowers the temperature. (168)
Remove veg slightly early to account for carryover instead of placing in an ice bath. (168)
Once done, spread veg out instead of piling it up, to prevent overcooking by trapped moisture. (168)
Boil tough greens like kale and then sauté. (169)
When reducing, place pan half on the burner. The boiling side will move fat to the still side for easy skimming. (170)
Steam and then brown carrots, sausages, and gyoza by adding water and cooking with lid ajar, then pouring off water and frying. (171)

#### Frying

Meat sticking to the pan means it’s not browned enough. (173)
Sauté is named for the flick of the wrist movement used to jump the food in the pan while frying. (174)
Preheat fat in the pan so food begins browning as soon as you add it. (172)
Don’t crowd the pan—it reduces the temperature and traps steam. (175)
If your stove doesn’t get hot enough for searing, pre-heat a cast iron pan in the oven. (176)

#### BBQ Tips

To impart a smokey flavour on a gas BBQ, put soaked wood chips in a disposable baking tin, cover with foil, poke holes, and place in BBQ out of direct flame, then cook food with BBQ lid closed. (153)
Never grill over the flame; cook over embers. (177)
Don’t allow rendering fat to drip and cause flare-ups. Move food around. (177)

### GENERAL TIPS

“The goal with all cooking is to achieve your desired result on the outside and the inside at the same time.”

#### Principles

Develop recipes backward from where you want to end up. (135)
Removing water concentrates flavour. Overwatering while growing ingredients dilutes their taste. (137)
Read several recipes for a dish and stick to the parts they have in common while playing around with the rest. (199)

#### Practical Tips

Use a bread knife to cut tomatoes. (205)
Never skimp on olive oil, parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chocolate. (207)
Worth the effort to DIY: grind your own spices, salt-packed anchovies, and chicken stock. (207)
Toss salad with your hands so you can feel when dressing has evenly coated the leaves. (215)
Remove beetroot skins after roasting whole by rubbing with a paper towel. (218)
Macerate onions in vinegar or citrus juice for 15 mins then use the liquid in salad dressing. (221)
To draw excess water out of cabbage for coleslaw, slice, place in colander, salt, and leave for 20 mins. (224)
If asparagus is thicker than a pencil, peal the stems. (235)
Make dressing in a jar by adding the ingredients and shaking. Store leftovers in the jar in the fridge. (249)
Toast cumin seeds by dry frying for 3 mins, swirling constantly. Grind immediately with a pinch of salt. (251)
If tahini dressing breaks, whisk with a few tablespoons of ice water. (251)
To blanch, boil leafy greens in salted water until tender, dry on a tray or wring out, then sauté. (258)
Steamy sauté: simmer veg covered until tender, then pour off water, add oil, and brown slightly. (261)
Roasting veg brings out sweetness, so pair with an acid sauce after cooking. (263)
Fry veg until nearly done, then make a hole in the centre of the pan and add oil and garlic. Sizzle for 20 seconds, then mix through and remove from heat. (264)
Dried beans triple in size when cooked. (280)
Soak dried beans with salt and bicarbonate of soda. (280)
You can use any beans to make hummus. (281)
Add garlic to hot fat and cook no more than 20 seconds, then add other ingredients to prevent browning. (295)
For crispy roast poultry, salt and leave overnight in the fridge uncovered. (316)
