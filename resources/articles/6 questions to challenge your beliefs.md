Ask yourself, and others, questions that force you to do a double-take on things you think

In NLP, this is known as making use of the Meta Model

To challenge beliefs, do the following:

- determine the source
	- who says / thinks X?
	- i.e. is the idea your own, is it someone else's opinion... something?
- determine if there is evidence
	- how do you know this?
	- i.e. is X based in reality?
- determine if the evidence correlates with the idea
- determine if the idea generalises
	- how often does X occur - always, sometimes, ever?
	- what stops _\[parties\]_ from doing Y?
	- i.e. is X true always true
- What is a more useful way of thinking about it?
- What do you need to do about it?
