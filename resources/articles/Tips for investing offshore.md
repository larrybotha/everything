## Takeaways

- a good target to convert Rands to Dollars is around R17.00 to the Dollar and R20.50 to the GBP
  - These levels are applicable in the current economic environment [2020] and it is worth remembering that circumstances change so the levels might change too
- If you live in South Africa and you have $100,000 worth of Vanguard ETF’s or Apple shares (as an example), you are liable for Estate Duty of 40% of your US assets, even though you don’t live in the US.
- ensure that your money lives in Switzerland, the Channel Islands, Ireland or Luxemburg – they are sound jurisdictions that do not tax non-residents
