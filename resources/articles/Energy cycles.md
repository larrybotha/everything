## Takeaways
- time management advice often ignores that our bodies have an ultradian rhythm - one hour is not the same as the next, because of bodies are under constant flux
- it's a good idea to monitor at which time of day we have energy peaks and dips, and adjust workflows accordingly
- like [[Andrew Huberman]], [[Josh Kaufman]] doesn't seem to be a proponent of *hacking*one's body
