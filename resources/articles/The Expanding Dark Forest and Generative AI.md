- dark forest theory - the universe is perhaps silent not because it is empty, but because survival of other societies depends on not being found
	- as a result, on the internet, many are retreating into "dark" places on the internet - media that cannot be publicly indexed, such as WhatsApp, Slack, newsletters
- due to automation of agents and generative content, it's useful to begin with the assumption that content on the internet is generated
	- articles
	- social media posts
	- video
	- audio
- the barrier to generating enormous amounts of average content have been eliminated
- an interesting experiment to improve agents was to build a sims world where each agent could draw from its own database - an ever-growing context. These agents exhibited interesting emerging behaviours, even going on dates in the sims world with each other
- AI should be thought of as a tool to make us work more effectively, rather than a replacement for skills
