## takeaways

- contains a speech [[Peter Kaufman]] made, describing [[The Multidisciplinary Approach to Thinking]]
- combining "go first, and be positive" with the underlying requirement of "consistency" required for compound interest to be observed makes for a powerful approach to living one's life

![[To understand is...]]

- mistakes are eliminated when you know what to do

![[The frog in the well...]]

- [[Charlie Munger]] suggested learning the "Big Ideas" from all the different disciplines
- [[Peter Kaufman]] read 144 interviews with scientists on Discover Magazine to achieve this, reading them all over 6 months
- [[Peter Kaufman]] derives his mental models from [[The Three Buckets of Knowledge]] he has happened on:
	- the inorganic universe, 13.7 billion years
	- Earth's biological history, 3.5 billion years
	- documented human history, 20 000 years
- if something is true for those 3 buckets, then it's generally true, and will apply to your life
- [[mirrored reciprocation]] is observable in the 3 buckets:
	- Newton's 3rd law - for every action there will always be an equal and opposite reaction
	- if you treat a cat well / poorly it will respond in kind and force
	- if you treat people well / poorly they will generally respond in kind
		- the people that don't are outliers - ignore that data, as we give it far more weighting than it deserves
- we have thus found a principle common to all 3 buckets - reciprocation
- [[Albert Einstein]] said there were 5 ascending levels of cognitive prowess:
	1. smart
	2. intelligent
	3. brilliant
	4. genius
	5. simple
- one should aim for simple - simple transcends genius. Simple is understandable, genius is not - e.g. Ethics by Spinoza
- another example:
	- Einstein claimed that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe - i.e. bucket 1
	- Kaufman describes compound interest as consistent incremental improvement over time
	- in bucket 2, evolution would be the analogue
	- in bucket 3, constant incremental improvement could be seen as slowly building wealth, becoming a world-class athlete, learning any complex skill
- thus, consistency is key to compound growth
	- we suffer from fatigue when attempting to be consistent, though. This is known as [[variance drain]] - stopping results in plateauing, or dropping below a previous level
- intermittency is dangerous for developing trust - consider erratic feeding of a puppy
- Kaufman's $8 crystal ball
	-  entire life you’ve been on a quest, an odyssey, a search for that individual that you can 100 percent absolutely and completely trust. But who’s not just trustworthy, but principled, and courageous, and competent, and kind, and loyal, and understanding, and forgiving, and unselfish
	- If you ever think you may have encountered this person, you are going to probe and probe and test and test to make sure that they are real, that you’re not being fooled. And the paradox is that it looks like you’re probing for weakness but you’re not. You’re probing for strength. And the worst day of your life is if instead of strength, you get back weakness. And now you feel betrayed. You know why? You’ve got to start your search all over again. It’s the worst thing in the whole world isn’t it?
	- every single other person in the whole world, has this list in their head – trustworthy, principled, courageous, competent, loyal, kind, understanding, forgiving, unselfish, and in every single one of your interactions with others, be the list
