## takeaways

- contains a speech [[Peter Kaufman]] made, describing [[The Multidisciplinary Approach to Thinking]]
- combining "go first, and be positive" with the underlying requirement of "consistency" required for compound interest to be observed makes for a powerful approach to living one's life

![[To understand is...]]

- mistakes are eliminated when you know what to do

![[The frog in the well...]]

- [[Charlie Munger]] suggested learning the "Big Ideas" from all the different disciplines
- [[Peter Kaufman]] read 144 interviews with scientists on Discover Magazine to achieve this, reading them all over 6 months
- [[Peter Kaufman]] derives his mental models from [[The Three Buckets of Knowledge]] he has settled on:
	- the inorganic universe, 13.7 billion years
	- Earth's biological history, 3.5 billion years
	- documented human history, 20_000 years
- if something is true for those 3 buckets, then it's generally true, and will apply to your life
- [[mirrored reciprocation]] is observable in the 3 buckets:
	- Newton's 3rd law - for every action there will always be an equal and opposite reaction
	- if you treat a cat well / poorly it will respond in kind and force
	- if you treat people well / poorly they will generally respond in kind
		- the people that don't are outliers - ignore that data, as we give it far more weighting than it deserves
- we have thus found a principle common to all 3 buckets - reciprocation
- [[Albert Einstein]] said there were 5 ascending levels of cognitive prowess:
	1. smart
	2. intelligent
	3. brilliant
	4. genius
	5. simple
- one should aim for simple - simple transcends genius. Simple is understandable, genius is not - e.g. Ethics by Spinoza
- another example:
	- Einstein claimed that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe - i.e. bucket 1
	- Kaufman describes compound interest as consistent incremental improvement over time
	- in bucket 2, evolution would be the analogue
	- in bucket 3, constant incremental improvement could be seen as slowly building wealth, becoming a world-class athlete, learning any complex skill
- thus, consistency is key to compound growth
	- we suffer from fatigue when attempting to be consistent, though. This is known as [[variance drain]] - breaks in consistency results in plateauing, or dropping below a previous level
- intermittency is dangerous for developing trust - consider erratic feeding of a puppy
- Kaufman's $8 crystal ball
	-  entire life you’ve been on a quest, an odyssey, a search for that individual that you can 100 percent absolutely and completely trust. But who’s not just trustworthy, but principled, and courageous, and competent, and kind, and loyal, and understanding, and forgiving, and unselfish
	- If you ever think you may have encountered this person, you are going to probe and probe and test and test to make sure that they are real, that you’re not being fooled. And the paradox is that it looks like you’re probing for weakness but you’re not. You’re probing for strength. And the worst day of your life is if instead of strength, you get back weakness. And now you feel betrayed. You know why? You’ve got to start your search all over again. It’s the worst thing in the whole world isn’t it?
	- every single other person in the whole world, has this list in their head – trustworthy, principled, courageous, competent, loyal, kind, understanding, forgiving, unselfish, and in every single one of your interactions with others, be the list

![[All you have to do, if you want everything in life from everybody else...]]

- people complain about not getting anything from the world, but [[mirrored reciprocation]] dictates that you'll get back only what you put in. If you do nothing, or only give negativity, that's what you'll get out
- when you walk into an elevator, you have 3 choices, and 98% of people will respond in kind:
	- smile and say hello
	- scowl
	- do nothing
- therefore, go first, and go positive
	- why doesn't everyone do this always? So that they avoid the pain that they'd receive from the 2% who would not reciprocate in kind
	- how can 2% be so powerful? [[Daniel Kahneman]] discovered that [[Loss aversion]] is assymetric, with loss having a far stronger effect than gain

![[Show me a man who is afraid of appearing foolish...]]

![[You know, I know 10 percent of people are going to screw me...]]

- in game theory:
	- you have a suboptimal outcome in any scenario where you add the word 'lose'
	- you have an optimal outcome every time you insert 'win-win'
	- see [[What game theory reveals about life, the universe, and everything]]
- how does one create win-win scenarios generally?
	- ![[If you could see the world the way I see it...]]
	- if the axiom's true, and you want to understand someone's behaviour, you need to see the world the way they do
	- if the axiom is true, and you want to change someone's behaviour, you need to change the way they see the world

> The secret to leadership is to see through the eyes of all six important counterparty groups and make sure that everything you do is structured in such a way to be win-win with them. So here are the six. Your customers, your suppliers, your employees, your owners, your regulators, and the communities you operate in. And if you can truly see through the eyes of all six of these counterparty groups and understand their needs, their aspirations, their insecurities, their time horizons – how many blind spots do you have now? Zero. How many mistakes are you going to make? You’re going to make zero.

	- going alone is a guarantee to a life of regret
