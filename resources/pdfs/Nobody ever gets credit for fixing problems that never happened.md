## Takeaways

- performance shortfalls can be addressed in one of two ways:
	- make people with harder / longer
	- improve the capabilities of the processes
- improving capabilities has a longer feedback loop, hence many managers default to the "work harder" strategy
- both loops reinforce themselves - i.e. the "reinforcement loop":
	- with the "work harder" loop, the more effort people have to put into working harder, the less time there have to dedicate to improving capability 
	- with the "improve capabilities" loop, as processes improve, and subsequent processes are then improved, workers gain more time to dedicate to improving other processes

- shortcuts may temporarily provide a performance boost, but usually at the cost of increased issues or maintenance later

- there is a "better-before-worse" trade-off that managers are often aware of when taking shortcuts
- people are biased towards putting blame on people, rather than on process:
	- is the training insufficient
	- are there maintenance issues associated with a particular person's performance
- working harder and taking shortcuts may give managers a false sense of having solved the problem - the belief that the people need to pick up their socks, not that capabilities need to be improved

> most organizations reward last- minute problem solving over the learning, training, and improvement activities that prevent such crises in the first place. As an engineer at an auto company told us, “Nobody ever gets credit for fixing problems that never happened.

> There are two theories. One says, ‘there’s a problem, let’s fix it.’ The other says ‘we have a problem, someone is screwing up, let’s go beat them up.’ To make improvement, we could no longer embrace the second theory, we had to use the first
