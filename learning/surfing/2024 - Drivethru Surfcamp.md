## Day 1

### Session 1

- power paddle
  * get chin to board to get into gliding
- gliding
  * should apply only light hand pressure
  * lean and look
    + torso should rotate left / right depending on direction wave is
      breaking - think 'eagle arms' while prone, only the torso rotates
- pop-up
  - back foot flat
  - hands up quickly
  - front foot 45def over stringer
  - chest over front knee
  - back elbow is shoulder height
- turtle roll
  - hold rails
  - press elbows into board
  - push nose down into wave

### Etiquette

- take 10-15 minutes to do a spot-check
  * watch sets
  * evaluate types of waves, size, swell direction, etc.
  * determine how good the other surfers are at the spot
- currents
  * rip is usually in the choppy section
  * good surfers will use the rip to get out - watch where the experienced people
    go when paddling out
- don't throw board
  * always try to keep contact with board at all times
- wave priority
  * for A-frames, call your direction if two of you are entering

## Day 2

- when paddling for a wave, look at full wave, 180deg
- before taking off, one must know:
  * the peak situation across the whole wave
  * whether anyone else is attempting to take the wave, either side of you
- use 2 landmarks to set your spot in the water, locatd in a straight line
- when there are multiple breaks at the same spot:
  * backline
    + biggest waves are found here
    + surfers here have priority over waves that are breaking shallower
  - mid-section
    * generally has the most opportunities for waves
    * requires a fair amount of turtle rolling / diving to get out or maintain position
    * need to watch for large waves breaking on you
    * good area to stay in, because one can paddle shallower or deeper, depending
      on how a set is breaking
  - shallow waves
    * requires a lot of diving to maintain position
    * surfers here have lowest priority for waves
- point break
  * wave has a consistent shape
  * wave breaks at the same point

```

1. behind the peak
  - advanced surfers
2. peak
  - requires fast take-offs
3. shoulder
  - requires paddling for the wave
  - lean and look
4. far from shoulder
  - long boarders can catch here
  - this area is good for taking a break and chilling between waves
