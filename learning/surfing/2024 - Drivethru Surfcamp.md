## Day 1

### Session 1

- power paddle
  - get chin to board to get into gliding
- gliding
  - should apply only light hand pressure
  - lean and look
    - torso should rotate left / right depending on direction wave is
      breaking - think 'eagle arms' while prone, only the torso rotates
- pop-up
  - back foot flat
  - hands up quickly
  - front foot 45def over stringer
  - chest over front knee
  - back elbow is shoulder height
- turtle roll
  - hold rails
  - press elbows into board
  - push nose down into wave

### Etiquette

- take 10-15 minutes to do a spot-check
  - watch sets
  - evaluate types of waves, size, swell direction, etc.
  - determine how good the other surfers are at the spot
- currents
  - rip is usually in the choppy section
  - good surfers will use the rip to get out - watch where the experienced people
    go when paddling out
- don't throw board
  - always try to keep contact with board at all times
- wave priority
  - for A-frames, call your direction if two of you are entering

## Day 2

- when paddling for a wave, look at full wave, 180deg
- before taking off, one must know:
  - the peak situation across the whole wave
  - whether anyone else is attempting to take the wave, either side of you
- use 2 landmarks to set your spot in the water, locatd in a straight line
- when there are multiple breaks at the same spot:
  - backline
    - biggest waves are found here
    - surfers here have priority over waves that are breaking shallower
  - mid-section
    - generally has the most opportunities for waves
    - requires a fair amount of turtle rolling / diving to get out or maintain position
    - need to watch for large waves breaking on you
    - good area to stay in, because one can paddle shallower or deeper, depending
      on how a set is breaking
  - shallow waves
    - requires a lot of diving to maintain position
    - surfers here have lowest priority for waves
- point break
  - wave has a consistent shape
  - wave breaks at the same point

```

1. behind the peak
  - advanced surfers
2. peak
  - requires fast take-offs
3. shoulder
  - requires paddling for the wave
  - lean and look
4. far from shoulder
  - long boarders can catch here
  - this area is good for taking a break and chilling between waves

## Day 3

- double-arm stroke is usually the last stroke before taking off
  - avoid using it for paddling into waves
  - can result in nose bobbing up and down as body lifts when arms go back,
    slowing the board down
- open legs at take-off removes the weight from the tail of the board, which can
   result in nose-dives
- avoid monkey-position - arms hanging ape-like
- person problem areas:
  - not compressed when riding
  - back foot is not flat
  - holding the rail during take-off limits movement - hands need to get up quickly
  - not looking where I'm going
    - at the top of the wave I'm looking over the wave
    - on the way down, I'm looking down the line, instead of at the bottom of the wave
- focus areas:
  - keep heal flat right from take-off
  - look at the turning points of the wave

### Duck-diving

- turtle rolls are the most efficient way for getting to the line for
  mid-length and longer boards
- it's important to generate speed for all diving techniques
- for 90% of waves it should be possible to dive without ditching the board
- paddling out straight to the line-up helps give an indication of the power of
  the waves
- duck dives
  - for a duck-dive, the forward motion from paddling is important in order to push
    the board under the water
  - the depth of the dive required differs depending on the energy of the waves
    - more powerful waves require deeper dives
  - eyes open underwater is useful, given you're not duck-diving through waves
    that are picking up sand
    - dark spots underwater are usually turbulent areas
    - look for light spots, turn the nose towards the light spots
  - for most waves, paddling straight into the wave is beneficial, but deviations
    may be useful, e.g. to avoid the lip breaking on you
- an efficient duck-dive will 'pop' you out of the back of the wave

#### 3 phases of a duck dive

- phase 1 - dive the board
  - shift your weight forward, aiming for pushing the nose into the water at
    60 degrees
  - lean over the front of your arms to drive the board down hard
- phase 2 - bring the board horizontal underwater using foot or knee
  - knee can be used for small waves
  - foot is required for powerful waves
  - bring your body to the board, otherwise you're pulling the board to the
    surface
- phase 3 - rise to the surface
  - this happens automatically
  - the water in the back side of the wave is rotating upwards, and will draw
    you out the back of the wave if the dive was executed correctly

## Day 4

- personal notes
  - struggled immensely with take-offs; first time at Madiha, BMT,
    taking off left...?
    - Raphi said to practice in white water
  - reiteration that back foot needs to be kept flat
  - not looking where I need to go
  - take-offs need a lot of work
    - get hands up quickly
    - rotate hips
    - stagger hands

### Video analysis

- gliding time should be used to evaluate wave on left and right
- take-offs
  - momentum of arms should bring body around
- land take-off / rotation exercises
  - land exercises for surfing should be highly exaggerated in order to execute
      the moves on water
  - standing rotations
    - stand straight with arms crossed over shoulders
    - rotate, attempting to get to 360 degrees, without jumping
  - squat exercise
    - squat
    - put leading hand down
    - rotate body using momentum from leading hand only, rotating away from
      down hand
  - 'high-5' exercise
    - prone
    - look up to head-height of a person
    - pop-up, rotating leading hand around as if to high-5 them
    - land feet in ready position, i.e. back foot across stringer,
      front foot 45 degrees over strings
    - should be performed exaggeratedly, attempting to land 180 degrees or more
      from prone position
- always let the wave crash out before exiting
  - bailing as a wave crashes puts strain on the leash which can then snap
  - ride the wave out, or exit over the should before it breaks
- Raphi uses tension in his leading hand to keep his arm raised
- personal feedback
  - staying too low - not extending enough / at all
  - avoid double paddles
    - double paddling rocks the board
    - double paddling also affects balance
  - focus on rotation during take-off - practice rotation exercises
  - staggered hands on take-off can assist with upper-body rotation
    - rotate the upper body as it's lifting
    - keep tension in upper-body while lifting
- emergency stops
  - used to get out of waves that you don't want to or shouldn't catch
  - lean back on tail, and push tail into the water
    - a powerful-enough lip can snap a board as it comes through
    - a deeper board is more difficult for the wave to snap
    - a deeper board is more stable as the wave passes through
- to go parallel with a wave, the leading shoulder / arm must be in line with
  the wave

## Day 5

- personal feedback from Raphi
  - focus on the following for take-offs, and in this order:
    - bringing hands up quickly - don't keep hands on board for stability
    - rotation of hips - use staggered hands
    - landing with back foot flat
  - internalise each step before moving on
  - practice on land, performing rotation exercises learnt on day 4 - exaggerate
    movements
  - remember to chill and enjoy the session
    - it's good to set goals for sessions, e.g. perform X task Y times, but it's
      important to also free-surf and just enjoy the experience
- group feedback from Raphi
  - etiquette is #1 - more important than skills
  - focus on 1 aspect learning at a time during a session
    - spend 20 - 30 minutes working on the task, then free-surf and enjoy the
      session
    - if you want to do more work, focus on some other aspect at a later time
      during the session
    - avoid spending an entire session working on something
    - avoid working on things when conditions are not good
  - practice on land
  - break every movement into its discrete parts, work to fix each individually
