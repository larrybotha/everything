In [[zero - the lambda calculus]] we've used [[identity - lambda calculus|identity]] as an equivalence for zero

This makes sense with respect to addition and subtraction under natural numbers, but is this definition of zero sufficient for products and division?

What are the other ways zero can be represented in lambda calculus, and what are the pros and cons of each?
