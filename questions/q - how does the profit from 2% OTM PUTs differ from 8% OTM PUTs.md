## Context

Trade X: Sell 1 31 Jan ZZZ 98 PUT@x' (2% OTM)
Trade Y: Sell  1 31 Jan ZZZ 92 PUT@y' (8% OTM)

We know x' > y'

As long as the market stays above 98, we know that:
 - Y will reach 80% profit sooner than X
 - Y's value can be booked and the trade rolled, potentially multiple times, before X expires or reaches 80% profit

Therefore, what must be true for one to prefer opening trades at 8% OTM vs 2% OTM?
