Incorporating interactions, time, systems, and the consequences of decisions to inform decisions

## takeaways

![[Failing to consider second-and third...]]

![[First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial...]]

- first-order thinking is fast and easy
	- solving the immediate problem without considering the consequences
- second-order thinking is deliberate
	- thinking in terms of interactions and time
	- using consequences to inform decision-making

### tools to employ second-order thinking

- ask, "and then what?"
- 10/10/10 - what do the consequences look like in 10 minutes, 10 months,and 10 years
- use a table with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order effects columns to assist decision-making
