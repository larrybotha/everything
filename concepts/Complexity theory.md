How difficult a given problem is

Includes classifications such as:

- P
- NP
- NP-Complete
- NP-Hard
- Exp

## takeaways

> think about complexity in terms of time as you scale the inputs that go into the algorithm that you’re using to solve the problem
> *[[The Impostor Handbook]]*

### polynomial time

- also known as "P time"
- Problems that scale according to a [[polynomial]] equation
- list operations, like sorting, searching, zipping, and enumeration are all P-time
- simple problems are usually P-time - not something you'd want to do exclusively as a developer

### exp time

- exponentially difficult problems, i.e. something of the form `2^n`
- a weighted graph is exp time

### All Solvable Problems (R)

- problems that can be solved

### Infinitely Complex Problems Beyond R

- problems that require an infinite asking of time to solve
	- e.g. [[The Halting Problem]]
- must problems that exist are undecidable

> it’s not possible to write a generalized program that can decide if any other program will halt.
