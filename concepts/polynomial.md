In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients which only employs the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. 

An example of a polynomial of a single variable x is `x² − 4x + 7`. An example in three variables is `x³ + 2xyz² − yz + 1`.
