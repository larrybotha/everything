Subtyping based on the operations that can be performed on an object. Operations are not necessarily inherited using a hierarchical approach, as in [[nominal subtyping]].

This is how Go's interfaces are implemented, and how `Protocol` in Python is used

It can be seen as a static version of [[duck typing]]

## examples

- `Iterable` in Python indicates that an object implements `__iter__`
