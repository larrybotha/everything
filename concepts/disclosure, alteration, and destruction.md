The opposite of the [[security triad]], i.e. the ways in which systems are attacked

- disclosure: disclosure of confidential information, i.e. an attack on confidentiality
- alteration: the unauthorised changing of data, i.e. an attack on integrity
- destruction / denial: destroying data, or preventing access to data, i.e. an attack on availability

Working towards protecting against disclosure, alteration, and destruction is equivalent to maintaining the security triad
