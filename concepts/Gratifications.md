The "enacting [of] personal strengths and virtues"

as opposed to

"Pleasure is defined as “delights [that] are immediate, come through the senses, and are momentary…needing little or no interpretation"

according to [[Martin Seligman]]

## Takeaways 

- pleasures easy are good, but are fleeting, while gratifications require more effort, but the effects are longer on our wellbeing
- depression appears to have a positive feedback loop with pleasures - the more one consumes, the worse one feels
- gratifications put one in a [[State of flow]], most pronounced when we perform a task that is fun and at the correct level of difficult
	- this reminds me of [[Scott Young]] citing studies related to [[The 85% Rule for Learning]]
- the more we engage in gratifications, the more we enjoy them
