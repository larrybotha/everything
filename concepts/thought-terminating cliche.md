- **Definitive-sounding**: They often have a confident, authoritative tone, making them seem like a definitive answer to a complex question.
- **Lack of substance**: Despite their convincing appearance, thought-terminating clichés rarely provide any actual insight, analysis, or evidence to support their claims.
