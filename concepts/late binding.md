- a mechanism in software development where the method on an object, function being called, is not known until runtime
- also known as *dynamic binding* or *runtime polymorphism*
- useful for working with generic types
- requires a lookup on a virtual table to determine which function to call, which makes late binding slower than [[early binding]]
