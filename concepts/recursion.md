The definition of something in terms of itself

In *general recursion*, the nesting depth of the sequence of items is unknown, and is equivalent to [[unbounded repetition]] through iteration with infinite memory

In *primitive recursion*, the number of repetitions is known, and thus the number of nested function calls is known, as with [[bounded repetition]] through iteration
