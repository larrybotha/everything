The increase and growth of muscle cells achieved through exercise

## takeaways

- there are two types of hypertrophy
	- Myofibrillar hypertrophy involves the growth of contractile elements of a muscle fiber, which increases strength and speed because the muscles can contract more forcefully
	- Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy refers to the growth of the non-contractile elements of a muscle fiber, like the energy-generating organelles and glycogen storage sites, which yields improvements in energy storage and endurance
- according to research in 2018, muscle damage is not required for hypertrophy: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29282529
