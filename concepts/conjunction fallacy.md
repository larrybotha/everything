The tendency to rate the probability of A occurring to be lower than A and B occurring

i.e. ignoring P(A) >= P(A,B)

It occurs because we tend to favour "judgement of representativeness"  over "judgement of probability" - by adding more details, the outcome may _seem_ more characteristic of the process that generates the outcome
