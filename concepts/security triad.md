When judging the security of a system, evaluating the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system, or CIA

- confidentiality: only intended persons or recipients have access to the data
- integrity: ensuring the data cannot be altered, or that changes are auditable
- availability: ensuring the system or service is available when needed

Beyond the security triad there are additional important factors for the security of a system:

- authenticity: is the source of information actually coming from the claimed source
    - i.e. if user X makes an order for P, we _know_ that X placed that order, and not Y
    * e.g. a violation of authenticity would be 1000s of fake orders for a product
- nonrepudiation: the original source is not in a position to deny having provided the data
    - i.e. we have an order for product P, user X is not in any position to deny having placed that order
    * e.g. a violation of nonrepudiation would be someone who orders a product, and then denies that they placed the order when it is delivered
