A [[security model]] that aims to achieve confidentiality of data via:

- [[Simple Security Property]]
- [[Star Security Property]]
- [[Discretionary-Security Property]]

The [[Simple Security Property]] and the [[Star Security Property]] can be summarised together as "write up, read down"

i.e. confidential information may be shared with people with a higher security clearance, and can be received from people with a lower security clearance

One of the the limitations of the Bell-LaPadula Model is that it is not designed to handle file-sharing

e.g. a file may be shared to someone with higher security clearance than you, but you would never be able to receive a file from them
