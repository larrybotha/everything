The avoidance of assigning fixed categories to things, and instead considering the degree of differing factors that are applicable

Questions to ask when categories are assigned to things:
- in what ways is this case similar to or different from these categories?
- can a Venn diagram better describe this case than a single category?
- if labels are ignored, what traits does this case have?

e.g. avoiding categorising someone as progressive or conservative, in favour of evaluating their stance on different issues

It is an antidote to the [[identification binary]] false dichotomy
