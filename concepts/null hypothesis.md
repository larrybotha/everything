The claim that no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being analysed

or

Any observed difference is due to chance alone, and an underlying causative relationship doesn't exist

## Takeaways
- is used in statistical inference along with alternative hypotheses
- if a random sample of data is consistent with the null hypothesis, do not reject the null hypothesis
- rejection of the null hypothesis is _not necessarily_ the real goal of a significance tester. An adequate statistical model may be associated with a failure to reject the null; the model is adjusted until the null is not rejected
- the null hypothesis is generally assumed to be possibly true
