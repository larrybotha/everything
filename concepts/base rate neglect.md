The tendency to ground our judgments in how intuitively “normal” a combination of attributes is, neglecting how common each attribute is in the population at large

e.g. is Sam more likely to be a shy librarian or shy salesperson?

The tendency would be to say librarian, but this ignores the base rate of librarians vs salespeople in the real world - there are _far_ more salespeople
