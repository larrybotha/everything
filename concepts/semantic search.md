The ability to search by meaning instead of keyword matching

e.g. 
_who invented penicillin_ - the correct result can be found by querying Wikipedia entries via keyword matching content
_who was the first person to win 2 Nobel prizes_ - the semantic meaning of the question needs interpretation in order to get the correct result

Some of the main approaches to approaches to semantic search:

- [[dense retrieval]]
- [[reranking]]
