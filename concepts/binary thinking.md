Viewing the world in an over-simplified "either-or" manner

Can be useful for inconsequential contexts, but is generally harmful in rational thinking contexts

Is often perpetuated by politicians and biased media by using simple dichotomies, resulting in polarisation and misinformation

Common forms of binary thinking:
- [[truth binary]]
- [[goodness binary]]
- [[identification binary]]

Is in contrast to [[nuanced thinking]]
