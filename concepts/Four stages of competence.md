In psychology, the four stages of competency that suggest that 
- individuals are initially unaware of how little they know, or unconscious of their incompetence
- as they recognize their incompetence, they consciously acquire a skill
- they then consciously use it
- eventually, the skill can be utilized without it being consciously thought through: the individual is said to have then acquired unconscious competence.
