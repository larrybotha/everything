In surfing, small adjustments on the face of the wave to maintain speed and position

- Surfers gently lean their weight over one side of the board to cause the board to travel in a particular direction.
- Used to adjust to the shape of a wave, going slightly higher or lower to surf the shoulder with the necessary speed to stay in the optimal position.
- Does not change direction; it is more like changing lanes on a highway than making a turn.
- Applied by shifting weight into the toes or heels of the front foot, mostly from the waist down
