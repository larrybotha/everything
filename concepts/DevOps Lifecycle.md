A set of continuous and collaborative practices that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations, promoting seamless integration, automation, and faster delivery of software. 

Phases:
1. Plan
2. Code
3. Build
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Operate
7. Feedback
8. Monitor

## Takeaways 

- brings siloed teams together - development and operations are tightly integrated, and collaborate much more fluidly
- the phases of the lifecycle:
	- plan - analysis of requirements, strategy, tech stack, budget, and feedback
	- code - design and implementation of requirements
	- build - also known as integration - pushing the work into a shared repository, beginning the CI process resulting in a build artifact
	- test - unit, integration, end-to-end, and QA tests, guided by the [[Test Strategy Document]] and test plans specific to each release.
		Automated testing is critical for tight feedback loops and for mitigating human error
	- deploy - the release of code to staging, UAT, and production environments
	- operate - the release is available to end users, with an operations team ensuring that the application has sufficient availability and stability 
	- feedback - the gathering of user feedback to make subsequent decisions, ideally automated
	- monitoring - gathering and analysing of real-time data to make subsequent decisions
- shifting testing and validation "left" means to test issues earlier and more frequently in the system than deferring to a later stage or team
