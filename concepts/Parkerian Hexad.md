Six security elements, including four from the [[security triad]]:

- availability
- utility
    - this describes how _useful_ the information is - i.e. is the information both available _and_ useful
    - e.g. an encrypted laptop, where the user has lost the key, is available, but has no utility
- integrity
- authenticity
- confidentiality
- possession
    * the requirement that data is protected from unauthorised taking, copying, or controlling
    * e.g. someone physically removing a hard drive from another's machine, or the unauthorised encryption of information for ransom - ransomware
