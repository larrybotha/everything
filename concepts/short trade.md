A short trade, or shorting a stock, is a bet that the value of the stock is
going to decrease.

- opening a short trade involves 'borrowing' someone else's stocks for a while
  to sell them
- closing a short trade involves buying back the borrowed stocks at the current
  market price
  - if the market price fell, you are buying them back for less than what you
    sold them, thus booking a profit
