 People’s general tendency to return to a set level of happiness despite life’s ups and downs

## Takeaways
- purchasing a new car may bring a fleeting sense of pleasure, which one may soon fade, encouraging one to purchase a new vehicle
- the first bite of something delicious generally brings more joy than the 3rd or 10th
- pleasures are fleeting, gratifications are longer lasting
- pleasures take little time, gratifications require significant time and effort
- pleasures should be enjoyed, but balanced with gratifications and meaningful activities

> pleasures are delights that have clear sensory and strong emotional components, what philosophers call 'raw feels': ecstasy, thrills…delight, mirth, exuberance, and comfort. They are evanescent, and they involve little, if any, thinking.
