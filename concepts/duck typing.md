A type system where an object is considered compatible with a given type if it has all the methods and attributes that the type requires

A form of polymorphism that doesn't rely on inheritance, instead relying on objects having common public methods and attributes

>  you can have objects that _quack_ like a duck and _walk_ like a duck rather than asking whether those objects are ducks

In Python, duck typing encourages the use of `hasattr` instead of `type` and `isinstance` for object evaluation
