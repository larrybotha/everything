the tendency for individuals to critically assess media reports in a domain they are knowledgeable about, yet continue to trust reporting in other areas despite recognizing similar potential inaccuracies

- e.g. reading an article in a newspaler about topic X which you are knowledgeable about, and identifying many flaws, then turning the page and reading about topic Y in which they are not experts, and agreeing with everything, not remembering their critique of the previous article

Does not seem to reliably generalise beyond of media:

- someone who lies repeatedly loses credibility
- in law, they have the term _[falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsus_in_uno,_falsus_in_omnibus "Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus")_ - untruthful in one part, untruthful in all
