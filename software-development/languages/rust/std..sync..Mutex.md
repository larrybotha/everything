```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

fn main() {
  let counter = Arc::new(
  Mutex::new(0));
  let mut handles = vec![];

  for _ in 0..10 {
    let handle = 
      thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut num = counter.lock()
                        .unwrap();

        *num += 1;
      });
    
    handles.push(handle);
  }

  for handle in handles {
    handle.join().unwrap();
  }

  println!(
    "Result: {}",
    *counter.lock().unwrap()
  );
}
```

- `Mutex` stands for [[mutual exclusion]] - only a single thread may access a value at a time
- a `Mutex` acts like a lock / key, allowing one to protect data from being
  modified while the lock is active

  - e.g. there are a bunch of kids, there is a malleable clay toy, and there
    is a key associated with that toy.

    - one of the children picks up the toy and the key, and they are allowed
      to play with the toy, and make modifications to it
      ```rust
      let mut toy = toy.lock().unwrap();
      ```
    - no other child may play with the toy while that child has the key
    - when the child is done with the toy, another child may take the key

      ```rust
      {
      // child a takes the toy
      	let mut locked_toy = toy.lock().unwrap();
      	// child a makes modifications
      } // lock goes out of scope and is dropped

      // child b takes the toy
      // ...
      ```

- a `Mutex` becomes _poisoned_ when
  - a thread holding a lock panics, and
  - that thread doesn't release the lock
	  e.g. a child with the toy starts freaking out, an adult comes along to soothe â€‹the child and takes them away, but the child continues to hold onto the toy, not allowing the other children to play with it
