From [[Amazing CTO]]

 - Did you invest in people, so you have someone to delegate to?
- Delegate tasks to juniors, features to developers, projects to senior developers and goals to your leads 
- What is the expected level of freedom the person has? 
- What is the frequency you would want to check in on results? Daily, weekly, in the end, never?
- Delegate authority together with the work. Make sure everyone knows
- Did you do everything to make the person successful? 
- Does the person know when they are successful? 
- Did you express all your expectations? Or do you have them only in your mind, and later you blame the person for not meeting them?
- Biggest mistake: “I would have done it differently”— Check results not solutions. What would you accept as a result?
- More delegation leads to capable people, less delegation leads to incapable people
