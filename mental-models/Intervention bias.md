The predisposition to introduce changes that arenâ€™t necessary in order to feel in control of a situation

## Takeaways 
- inaction is sometimes more beneficial than satisfying the need to feel like something is being done
- to counter Intervention Bias, evaluate the [[null hypothesis]]. Examine what would happen using the following approaches:
	- what would happen if you do nothing
	- what would happen if you assume the situation has arisen accidentally or by error
	- ask, "do we need to do this at all?"
- related to [[Absence Blindness]] because humans tend to give value to things they can see, and not paying attention to things they can't see
- corporate bureaucracy often stems from Intervention Bias - "fix" bad things by adding layers of reporting, auditing, or protocol. This increases overhead, and reduces throughput - [[Opportunity cost]]

![[For every complex problem there is an answer that is...]]

## Relations
- [[Absence Blindness]] - we value things we can see over things we cannot
- [[Throughput]] - Intervention Bias can result in a needless addition of bureaucracy and reduction in throughput 
- [[null hypothesis]] - consider the effect of doing nothing when a problem arises
- [[Opportunity cost]] - needlessly introducing procedures, reporting, or auditing reduces throughput
