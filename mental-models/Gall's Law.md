![[A complex system that works...|A complex system that works...]]

---
## Notes 
- building a complex system from the outset has a higher cost and likelihood of failure than starting with a simpler system
- a working complex system is derived from expanding on a working simpler system

## Relations
- [[Incremental augmentation]] - small changes to a working system allow one to respond to change more fluidly - think [[Minimum viable change (MVC)]] ala GitLab
- [[Critical assumptions]]
- [[Minimum viable offer]] 
- [[Iteration Cycles]]
- [[Prototyping]]
- [[Selection tests]]
- [[Uncertainty]]
