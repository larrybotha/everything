The brain's coping mechanism whereby reality is simplified when it receives to much information

## Takeaways
- in areas of high density, people view other people as obstacles, rather than people, e.g. Times Square
- executives may make decisions that seem rotten to the core, such as dumping waste into rivers, but it's possible that [[Cognitive Scope Limitation]] from the volume of considerations they are responsible for has limited their ability to clearly evaluate the situation
- to overcome Cognitive Scope Limitation, personalise the issue using 2 time frames:
	- present - the "newspaper rule": assume your decision will be publicised and your significant others would read it - what would they think?
	- future - the "grandchild rule": assume your decision would have a direct impact on one of your grandchildren in 20 or 30 years - what would they think?
- there is an upper limit on the number of personal connections we can maintain, e.g. keeping in contact with all school peers is untenable - we already have many closer connections that require our energy
	- "Dunbar's number" puts the limit at about 150
	- "Bernard-Killworth Median" puts the limit at around 290
- when a disaster affects millions of people, we don't feel millions of times worse than if it were a few people
