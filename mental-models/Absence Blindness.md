Humans have a hard time realising what isn't there, or

We value things we can see more than things we cannot

## Takeaways
- good managers get things done and under budget, which may go unnoticed
- poor managers may be constantly fighting fires, perhaps of their own creation, and may be rewarded for it because their effort is noticed
- people who excel at some activity make it look easy, but it's not obvious how much work and effort has gone into becoming skilled
- selling the prevention or absence of something is an uphill battle
	- e.g. climate disaster 
- doing nothing is sometimes the best action, i.e. letting people suffer the consequences of their actions
	- this becomes difficult for governments, because doing nothing may look like apathy or inaction, e.g. bailing out investment banks during the financial crisis vs letting them crash and burn
- [[Opportunity cost]] is a form absence blindness

## Ways to overcome the bias
- consider how you want something to look, and use checklists to get there
- speak to people who are experienced in what you're attempting to find discover unknown unknowns 
- when selling products and services, state benefits in terms of positive, immediate, concrete, and specific terms by focusing on things that can be directly experienced
