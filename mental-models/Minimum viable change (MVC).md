GitLab's approach to rapidly releasing features to users by deploying the smallest possible change that 
- adds value for users
- moves the product or feature closer to it's optimal or desired state
- mitigates over-engineering
- is easier to roll back than a big change
- mitigates conflicts that large deployments are more prone to
- encourages solving problems with a *good enough* approach, i.e.  [[Pareto Principle|80/20 Rule]] 
- forces team members to find the simplest solution, which is often the best solution
- allows for obtaining feedback from users to drive subsequent iterations
- mitigates feature bloat through user research to validate market need

## Relations

- [[Incremental augmentation]] - the incremental improvement of an offer, as opposed to deploying large iterations
- [[Feedback]]
- [[Pareto Principle]] - focus on *good enough* for 80% of users
