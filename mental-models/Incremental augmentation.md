Minimising the risk that large iterations introduce by instead using [[Iteration Cycles]] to add new benefits to an offer incrementally

![[Pick three key attributes...]]

## Notes

To remain competitive, one needs to continually improve on the service or product they offer

Incremental augmentation encourages:
- improving on what works
- discarding what doesn't 

### Pros
- minimises risk
- allows one to get feedback before investing time in the wrong approach
- allows for more rapidly releasing improvements

### Cons
- incremental augmentation may be insufficient when entering a new market, or changing an existing one - something entirely new may need to be created

## Analogies
- modding cars - start with a stock car, incrementally upgrading parts until you've created the best car - an entirely new machine

## Relations 

- [[Iteration Cycles]] 
- [[Minimum viable offer]]
- [[Critical assumptions]] 
- [[Feedback]]
- [[Testing]]
- [[Minimum viable change (MVC)]]
- Agile methodology
- [[Ooching]]
