The "freeze" response organisms enter when presented with an external threat, which makes it difficult to do anything except focus on the threat

## Takeaways
- one of the physiological "protection moves" organisms enter when faced by external threats - the fight, flight, freeze, or fawn responses 
- [[Mental simulation]] largely governs your ability to exit protection mode - what can your brain predict about your ability to get out of the situation
- it may result in a positive feedback loop - external threats may inhibit action, which in turn may exacerbate the external threat
- laying people off can create *Threat Lockdown* amongst employees - laying off of staff should be done quickly, and remaining staff should be made comfortable that their jobs are safe
- studies (TODO: find sources) have shown that attempting to repress the response results in an increase in strength of the response
- to deal with *Threat Lockdown*:
	- demonstrate to yourself that there was never a threat, or
	- convince yourself the threat has passed, or 
	- use the body to calm the mind - [[Non-sleep deep rest]]
