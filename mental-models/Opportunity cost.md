The value given up when making a decision

# Takeaways
- investing time, energy, or resources prevents us from investing that time, energy, or resource elsewhere
- if you're making $30k at Company A, and Company B parts $200k for the same work, why would you stay?
- if employees are paid $30p/hr at your company, but $50p/hr at another for the same work, why would they stay?
- what would make a customer want to spend $200 for a service when they already get the same service elsewhere for $20?
- every decision has an opportunity cost
- paying attention to opportunity cost make allows one to make better decisions
