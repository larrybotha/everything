A process that can be used to iteratively improve anything, using the WIGWAM acronym:
- **W**atch: what works, and what doesn't
- **I**deate: what can be improved
- **G**uess: based on experience, which idea will have the biggest impact
- **W**hich: decide which change to make
- **A**ct: make the change
- **M**easure: is the outcome positive or negative, and how should one move forward

## Takeaways
- acronym seems forced and unintuitive...
- applying the [[DevOps Lifecycle]] would likely be a good alternative to WIGWAM, as each phase is clear and actionable, even outside of software development

## Relations

- [[Prototyping]]
- [[Iteration velocity]]
- [[Field testing]]
