The events that are within your control, in contrast to those that you have no influence over

## Takeaways
- develop a clear separation between things you can control and things you can't
- let go of everything you can't control
- focus on things you can put effort into - *not the result* 
	- e.g. "losing weight" is the *result* of changing eating habits, exercise, etc

## Relations
- [[Scenario planning]]
- [[Goal setting]] - people make *results* the focus of their goals, when *effort* should be the focus
- [[Comparison Fallacy]]
- [[Attachment]]
- [[Mystique]]
- [[Opportunity cost]] - focusing on things like the news, outside of one's locus of control, takes time away from doing things that do have an impact on your life
