The assumption that itâ€™s possible to compare your skills, priorities, goals, and results with other people in an accurate and useful manner

## Takeaways
- comparing one's self to others is fruitless - we all have different skills, priorities, and challenges
- the metrics that matter:
	- are you doing work you enjoy?
	- is it with people you enjoy?
	- does it make you financially sufficient?
- a possible response to other's success is feeling sad for ourselves, when we could instead feel happy for others
- by focusing on other's success, we often miss what they've had to pay in order to get there, and maintain it
- are you willing to pay the price others have paid for the ways they are successful, or do your goals and priorities lie elsewhere?

## Relations
- [[Goal setting]] - focus on your priorities rather than others; what's important to others may not be important to you
- [[Locus of control]] - focus on what you can control
- [[Absence Blindness]] - someone else's success may come at a cost that's not obvious, and that you wouldn't be willing to pay
- [[Status Seeking]] - the behaviour that ensures we spend our time tracking what others are doing, which in turn relates to [[Opportunity cost]]
- [[Overhead]] - what is the ongoing cost of maintaining someone else's success?
- [[Tradeoff]] - what does one have to give up in order to achieve their goals?
- [[Hedonic Treadmill]]
- [[Energy cycles]]
