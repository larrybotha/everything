Having the toughness and flexibility to handle whatever is thrown at you

## Takeaways
- the world is full of [[Uncertainty]] - the ability to adjust your strategy and tactics as conditions change can be the difference between survival and disaster
- resilience is not optimal when evaluated through [[Throughput]] - flexibility is often the price
	- e.g. a tortoise shell is great for defence, but comes at the cost of agility and speed
	- many investment banks view having cash on-hand (i.e. to manage risk) as a waste, and thus attempt to squeeze every dollar out of the company by overleveraging themselves many times over. Small drops in the market, or being sued, can severely impact these organisations' ability to weather the storm
	- a 6 month emergency fund may seem like a lot of money to keep "in case", but Covid 19 is a good example of where an emergency fund would have made families more resilient to the pandemic
- what makes a business resilient:
	- Low (preferably zero) outstanding debt
	- Low overhead / fixed costs / operating expenses
	- Substantial cash reserve for unexpected contingencies
	- Multiple independent products / industries / lines of business
	- Flexible workers / employees that can handle many responsibilities well
	- No single points of failure
	- [[Fail-safes]] / backup systems for all core processes
