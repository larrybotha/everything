To hold two conflicting ideas in constructive tension

## Takeaways
- akin to how much opposable thumbs allow primates to do things with their hands that other species can't, being able to hold opposing ideas allows one to develop new ideas that combine both ideas, but is stronger
- integrative thinking: “The ability to face constructively the tension of opposing ideas and, instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is superior to each”.
- coined by [[Roger Martin]]
