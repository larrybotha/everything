Asking questions about an attempted solution, Y, instead of asking how to solve the root problem, X

## Takeaways

- if Y is not a correct solution, it will obscure what is attempting to be solved
- when asking questions
	- ask about solutions to the problem, not *how to fix your solution*
- when answering questions, or helping find a solution
	- make sure you understand the root of the problem 
	- ask probing questions to identify the root of the problem, e.g. [[The Mom Test]]
		- e.g. what are you trying to solve?
