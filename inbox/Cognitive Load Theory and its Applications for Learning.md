- Cognitive Load Theory is the dominant paradigm for designing learning materials

## Takeaways

- some things are learnt innately, such as language for children, and cultural norms, while others require guidance from others, such as maths and literacy
- [[John Sweller]] developed the theory
- a lack of fundamentals committed to long-term memory can make learning new skills difficult to learn
- cognitive load theory claims there are 3 demands that occupy our working memory:
	- intrinsic load
		- the attention required to learn a pattern that will be committed to long-term memory
	- extraneous load
		- distractions which consume working memory:
			- TV or music in the background
			- poorly designed study materials
			- flipping between pages to understand material
			- figuring out a pattern that could be taught explicitly
	- germane load
		- effortful practice that improves the ability to recall ideas later, but are not strictly necessary in order to learn a pattern
		- e.g.
			- using [[The Feynman Technique]]
			- self explanation 
			- retrieval practice 
- working memory has a fixed capacity - if intrinsic load doesn't occupy all of our working memory, we have capacity to benefit from germane load. The opposite is also true - if cognitive load is overwhelming, then more challenging forms of reinforcement are not effective

### Key Experiments

- worked examples are more effective than problem solving when cognitive load is high
	- e.g. walking through a problem step-by-step is more effective for novices than asking them to solve the problem for themselves
	- germane load is beneficial only once the cognitive load diminishes 
- Goal-Free effect
	- solving a problem implicitly requires that you store a goal in memory, while attempting to devise a procedure to get there - this introduces a lot of cognitive load
	- removing the goal from a problem is one way of reducing cognitive load
		- e.g.
			- in trig, "solve for `x`" - goal-oriented, vs "find as many angles as you can"
			- The [[XY problem]] vs brainstorming without filtering
