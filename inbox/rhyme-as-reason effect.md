Rhyming sentences are often judged as more accurate

this appears to be a result of the language makes it easier to process, i.e. it has a low processing fluency, which makes statements appear more truthful

e.g. "woes unite foes" means the same thing as "woes unite enemies", yet the former is perceived to be "more accurate"
