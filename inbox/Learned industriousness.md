When you are rewarded for expending higher effort, the experience of effortful activity itself is reinforced. This leads to the experience of effort itself becoming less unpleasant, and thus changes your willingness to work harder for bigger payoffs.

## Takeaways

- developed by [[Robert Eisenberger]]
- being rewarded for effort, makes that effort less unpleasant, making one more willing to work harder for better payoffs
- someone who is used to exerting effort in one domain for better rewards is more likely to generalise the behaviour to other domains
- goals are one way to 'learn' industriousness
	- In addition to improving performance, [[Goal setting]] also increases task effort and persistence
